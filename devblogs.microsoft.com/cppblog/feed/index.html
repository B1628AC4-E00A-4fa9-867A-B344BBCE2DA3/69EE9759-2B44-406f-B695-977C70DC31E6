										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Sykes and Juan Carlos Arevalo Baeza (JCAB) are both Principal Software Engineers who work on the Time Travel Debugging team at Microsoft, which is the team that maintains and develops the Windows Debugger (WinDbg) and related technologies. Their codebase is developed with C++ and CMake, and they primarily use Visual Studio Code for developing their code.</p>
<p>They have been integrating<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot"> GitHub Copilot</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide">GitHub Copilot Chat</a> into their C++ development in VS Code and have found many useful workflows for the AI pair programmer.</p>
<p><em>This blog post series has been written in partnership with Ken and JCAB to highlight their successful workflows with GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat respectively and inspire other C++ developers on potential use cases to integrate with their coding workflows.</em></p>
<p><em>This blog post series has been written in partnership with Ken and JCAB to highlight their workflows with Copilot and Copilot Chat respectively and inspire other C++ developers on potential use cases to integrate with their code. </em></p>
<p><em>To view the first blog post on Copilot, please visit <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/how-copilot-is-being-used-by-the-time-travel-debugging-team-for-repetitive-c-coding/">this link</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-they-use-copilot-chat">How they use Copilot Chat</h2>
<p>They have integrated Copilot Chat as a search tool and pair programmer when coding, as it has provided applicable and relevant answers to some of their programming questions for their codebase.</p>
<p>For example, some sample scenarios that JCAB uses Copilot Chat to help with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning how to find, install, and use various tools</li>
<li>Asking programming documentation questions</li>
<li>Asking coding questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Example questions and actual responses provided by Copilot Chat are enumerated below by JCAB throughout his workflows.</p>
<h3 id="learn-how-to-find-install-and-use-various-tools">Learn how to find, install, and use various tools</h3>
<h4 id="installing-tools"><em>Installing Tools</em></h4>
<p>For Windows users, it is not natural to know how to install various Linux tools, but it is necessary for Linux development on their WSL Ubuntu machines. Luckily, Copilot Chat was able to get us close to the right set of directions to do so by iterating over the prompt. For example, I was curious about learning more about acquiring clang via package manager.</p>
<p>Please note, it is always a good idea to validate Copilot responses to ensure they are correct.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">jcab_microsoft: How do I list &#8220;apt&#8221; packages that match a portion of their names?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: You can use the `apt-cache search` command to list all packages that match a portion of their names. Here&#8217;s how you can do it: </span></p>
<pre>apt-cache search &lt;package-name-portion&gt;</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
Replace `&lt;package-name-portion&gt;` with the portion of the package name you&#8217;re interested in. This command will return a list of all packages that contain the specified string in their name or description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">For example, to search for all packages that contain the word &#8220;python&#8221; in their name or description, you would use:</span></p>
<pre>apt-cache search python</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
This will return a list of all packages related to Python.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Ubuntu’s “apt” packages tend to be quite old, so it defaults to clang 14 and offers “clang-15” as an opt-in. But apparently, there’s a way to get packages directly from the makers.</p>
<p>I didn’t know about this but asked the basic question anyway and Copilot delivered wonderfully. In the end, this got me brand-spanking-new clang 19 without breaking a sweat.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: How can I get a current version of clang in my Ubuntu 22?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: To get the current version of Clang on Ubuntu 22.04, you can use the LLVM project&#8217;s own repositories. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: times;">First, add the LLVM repository to your system:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre>wget -O - <a href="https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key">https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key</a> | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb <a href="https://apt.llvm.org/focal/">https://apt.llvm.org/focal/</a> llvm-toolchain-focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-family: times;">Update the package list:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-family: times;">Install Clang:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre>sudo apt-get install clang</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">This will install the latest stable version of Clang available in the LLVM repository. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">To check the installed version of Clang, you can use the following command:</span></p>
<pre>clang --version</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Please note that the LLVM repository might not always have the absolute latest version of Clang, but it generally has more recent versions than the official Ubuntu repositories.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In general, I like to use iterative questions with Copilot Chat to understand how to install tools, especially in unfamiliar territories and can probe for more information when prompted.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, it’s a good idea to check Copilot responses for issues. In this case, it suggested to use a command “apt-key” which is deprecated. Luckily in this case, that command provided good instructions on how to do it the non-deprecated way.</p>
<h3 id="ask-about-programming-documentation">Ask about programming documentation</h3>
<p>Despite being an experienced C++ and Windows developer, I don&#8217;t know everything! But I can ask C++ and Windows-specific questions for my programming and see that Copilot Chat is very helpful.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: What was the NTSTATUS generated by a fastfail in Windows?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: The `NTSTATUS` code generated by a fastfail in Windows is `0xC0000409`, which corresponds to `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`. This status code indicates that a stack buffer overrun has occurred in the application, compromising the integrity of the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">When a fastfail occurs, the process is terminated immediately without running any exception handling or cleanup code. This is designed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities from being exploited.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Note that Copilot isn’t perfect, and its information can sometimes be out of date, so sometimes I use it as a nudge in the right direction (see <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230731-00/?p=108505">this blog from 2023</a> clarifying this information, although this is what was meant at first).</p>
<p>And sometimes, documentation questions turn into code questions.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: In C++, is there a way to wait for multiple synchronization objects?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: In C++, there isn&#8217;t a direct way to wait for multiple synchronization objects like you can in some other languages or platforms (for example, `WaitForMultipleObjects` in Windows API). However, you can achieve similar functionality using condition variables along with a status check for the objects you&#8217;re interested in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Here&#8217;s a simplified example:</span></p>
<pre>#include &lt;mutex&gt;

#include &lt;condition_variable&gt;

#include &lt;vector&gt;

std::mutex mtx;

std::condition_variable cv;

std::vector&lt;bool&gt; objects_ready; // replace with actual status of your objects

void wait_for_objects() {

    std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mtx);

    cv.wait(lock, []{ 

        // This is a predicate function that checks if all objects are ready

        for (bool is_ready : objects_ready) {

            if (!is_ready) return false;

        }

        return true;

    });

}

void set_object_ready(int index) {

    std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mtx);

    objects_ready[index] = true;

    cv.notify_all(); // notify all waiting threads

}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">In this example, `wait_for_objects` waits until all objects are ready. `set_object_ready` sets an object as ready and notifies all waiting threads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Please note that this is a simplified example and may not be suitable for all use cases. Depending on your needs, you may need to use a different synchronization mechanism or a third-party library.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ask-coding-questions">Ask coding questions</h3>
<p>In my current line of work, I often need to find how to do a given Windows thing in Standard C++ and/or Linux. Below are some questions I’ve asked Copilot Chat that have been highly performant and helpful.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">jcab_microsoft: what is the standard C++ way to implement _BitScanForward?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Github Copilot: `_BitScanForward` is a Microsoft-specific intrinsic function that is not part of the C++ standard library. However, you can use the `__builtin_ctz` function in GCC and Clang to achieve the same functionality. Here&#8217;s an example implementation:</span></p>
<pre>#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

#ifdef _MSC_VER

#include &lt;intrin.h&gt;

#endif

uint32_t BitScanForward(uint32_t mask)

{

#ifdef _MSC_VER

    unsigned long index;

    _BitScanForward(&amp;index, mask);

    return index;

#else

    return __builtin_ctz(mask);

#endif

}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">This implementation checks if the code is being compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ (indicated by the `_MSC_VER` macro) and uses `_BitScanForward` if it is. Otherwise, it uses the `__builtin_ctz` function to achieve the same functionality. Note that `__builtin_ctz` returns the number of trailing zeros in the input, so you may need to subtract the result from the bit width of the input type to get the index of the first set bit.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Notice that Copilot Chat didn’t necessarily fully answer the question using C++20 standards, but still provided some level of guidance for me. Again, it can be important to iterate with Copilot if this is a priority for you.</p>
<p>And some more for porting over code&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: How can I get the _byteswap_ulong intrinsic in clang?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: The `_byteswap_ulong` intrinsic is specific to Microsoft&#8217;s compiler. In Clang, you can use the `__builtin_bswap32` function to achieve the same functionality. Here&#8217;s an example:</span></p>
<pre>#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

uint32_t byteswap_ulong(uint32_t value)

{

    return __builtin_bswap32(value);

}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">In this function, `__builtin_bswap32` reverses the byte order of a 32-bit value, which is equivalent to what `_byteswap_ulong` does in Microsoft&#8217;s compiler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: What about a clang intrinsic for _mul128?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: Clang does not have a direct intrinsic for `_mul128`. However, you can use the built-in type `__int128` to perform 128-bit multiplication. Here&#8217;s an example:</span></p>
<pre>#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

void mul128(int64_t a, int64_t b, int64_t* high, int64_t* low) {

    __int128 result = static_cast&lt;__int128&gt;(a) * static_cast&lt;__int128&gt;(b);

    *high = result &gt;&gt; 64;

    *low = result;

}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">In this function, `a` and `b` are the 64-bit integers to multiply, and `high` and `low` are pointers to 64-bit integers where the high and low 64 bits of the result will be stored, respectively. The function first casts `a` and `b` to `__int128` and performs the multiplication, then it stores the high and low 64 bits of the result in `*high` and `*low`, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: What&#8217;s the best equivalent on Linux to fastfail?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: On Linux, the closest equivalent to Windows&#8217; `fastfail` would be to use the `abort()` function from the C Standard Library. This function causes the program to terminate abnormally and generate a core dump file for post-mortem analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Here&#8217;s how you can modify the `DBG_FAIL` macro in your code to use `abort()`:</span></p>
<pre>#define DBG_FAIL(...)          abort()</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
This will cause the program to terminate immediately when `DBG_FAIL` is called, similar to how `fastfail` works on Windows. However, please note that unlike `fastfail`, `abort()` does not allow you to specify an exit code. The program will always return with a status indicating abnormal termination.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>And always, if in doubt, never hesitate to ask for clarification and pointers to the relevant documentation.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: times;">
jcab_microsoft: Do you have any pointers to references expanding on the use of abort() in place of __fastfail()?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">GitHub Copilot: The use of `abort()` in place of `__fastfail()` is a common practice in Unix-like environments, including Linux, where `__fastfail()` is not available. The `abort()` function raises the `SIGABRT` signal, causing the process to terminate unless the signal is caught by a signal handler. This is similar to how `__fastfail()` works on Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Here are some references that discuss the use of `abort()`:</span></p>
<p>&#8211; [abort &#8211; C++ Reference](<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/abort/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/abort/</a>)</p>
<p>&#8211; [abort &#8211; Linux man page](<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/abort.3.html">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/abort.3.html</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">These references provide detailed information about how `abort()` works and how it can be used to terminate a process in response to a fatal error or security violation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times;">Please note that while `abort()` is similar to `__fastfail()`, there are some differences. For example, `abort()` does not allow you to specify an exit code, and it does not guarantee that the process will terminate immediately in all circumstances. If you need more control over the termination process, you may need to use a different function or mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of our favorite ways to use Copilot is to have it follow existing coding patterns to save typing. For example, we have a class that interacts with <code>dbghelp.dll</code> through function pointers (GetProcAddress-based delay loading). Recently we needed to add some additional dbghelp methods to this class, such as </span><code>SymInitializeW</code><span data-contrast="auto">. All we need to do is go to the places that define existing structs, press enter and start to type, and Copilot will dynamically update to fill in the rest. Then, we can edit down the results to get to the desired outcome.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}"> </span></p>

<p>After adding this new class member, we can scroll up to the constructor and notice that Copilot is able to offer a valid initialization suggestion for us.</p>

<p>Then, add the prototype for the wrapper and Copilot can offer a reasonable implementation.</p>

<p>A more complex example of Copilot helping with initializations can be viewed below for now a new Load Module object.</p>

<p>In this example, Copilot can generate the implementation of the method with great default options. These default options are also commented by Copilot to document what the zeros and nullptrs mean.<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/SymLoadModules2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33870 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/SymLoadModules2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif" alt="A Gif showcasing the initialization of a function Load Module.

<p>We have found Copilot helpful with managing libraries in our repository and refactoring code. Specifically, we previously used the rapidJSON library, managed through a <code>vcpkg.json</code> file, to serialize our structs into JSON.</p>
<p>An example of such a struct of information can be viewed here:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-struct.png"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-33871 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-struct.png" alt="An example struct of system information such as major/minor version, and struct of processor architecture related information" width="678" height="759" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-struct.png 901w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-struct-268x300.png 268w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-struct-768x860.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>The original rapidJSON code was hand-written and took hours to do (including time to become familiar with the library). While producing this blog, we found that Copilot could generate much of the code correctly once some rapidJSON boilerplate code is provided. See how easily Copilot can generate the JSON object using pre-determined o and s objects for rapidJSON:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Generate-rapidJSON.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33873" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Generate-rapidJSON.gif" alt="a GIF showcasing generating all the objects under object o and object s using the struct information above and rapidJSON library construct with Copilot." width="1530" height="844" /></a></p>
<p>We recently had a desire to update this library dependency from rapidJSON to nlohmann-json, since the nlohmann-json library is better-maintained.  To start updating the code, all we needed to do was update our <code>vcpkg.json</code> dependencies to have a nlohmann-json entry and include this new dependency in our cpp file per official library documentation.</p>
<p>From there, Copilot was able to produce 80% of the code for this process with the proper formatting for nlohmann-json, letting the team focus on reviewing the generated code rather than implementing the fixes in applicable areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/JSONGeneratev2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33894" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/JSONGeneratev2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif" alt="Image JSONGeneratev2 ezgif com crop" width="1530" height="664" /></a></p>
<h5 id="generating-code-based-on-input-data"><em>Generating code based on input data</em></h5>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference code:</span> <a href="https://github.com/KenSykes/ExampleLibraryConversion/blob/convert_to_nlohmann/ExampleParser.cpp"><em>Branch: convert_to_nlohmann, File: ExampleParser.cpp</em></a></p>
<p>Copilot can also save you time writing parsing code. Given some sample input data pasted in a comment, Copilot can generate C++ structures and parsing code for you. To demonstrate this, we started with the nlohmann JSON parser, added a conversion for <code>std::string</code>, and then pasted some sample JSON from openweathermap.org in a comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-JSON-data.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33895" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-JSON-data.png" alt="An example of JSON data from openweather.org passed into a comment in the code" width="781" height="1042" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-JSON-data.png 781w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-JSON-data-225x300.png 225w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/example-JSON-data-768x1025.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, watch Copilot go to work. Move cursor below the comment and hit Enter. You will start to get suggestions for code. Keep pressing Tab and Enter as Copilot writes out all the structures to represent the data and the nlohmann <code>to_json()</code> / <code>from_json()</code> methods, culminating in a <code>ParseWeatherData()</code> method that can fully parse the sample text.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/LibraryParserv2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33897" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/LibraryParserv2-ezgif.com-crop-1.gif" alt="An example of Copilot generating all the data for to_json and from_json functions for the library parser based on the weather data commented." width="1171" height="1040" /></a></p>
<p>The full Copilot-generated code can be found <a href="https://github.com/KenSykes/ExampleLibraryConversion/blob/convert_to_nlohmann/ExampleParser.cpp">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you look closely that the Weather field of WeatherData is a single element but the JSON is an array, so a <code>std::vector&lt;&gt;</code> would have been a better choice. Things like this are easy to fix up on your own, or perhaps add more representative JSON samples to the comment to give Copilot more context.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/weatherdatastruct.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33898 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/weatherdatastruct.png" alt="Image weatherdatastruct" width="421" height="595" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/weatherdatastruct.png 421w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/weatherdatastruct-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></a></p>

<p>Pure Virtual C++ is our free one-day virtual conference for the whole C++ community. This year it will run on <strong>April 30</strong><strong>th 15:00 UTC. </strong><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/22077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign-up for free</a> to get access to our five sessions on the day and a host of pre-conference content.</p>
<p>Here is the list of sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Testing of Shader Code with Keith Stockdale</strong> (Rare) &#8211; Rare has a rich culture of writing automated tests for their game and engine code. The &#8216;Sea of Thieves&#8217; project has hundreds of thousands of automated tests that exist to validate behavior and to ensure that bugs are kept to a minimum, as we continually deliver an ever-changing experience to players. Among this large test suite are tests that validate and verify shader code. This session explores the new Rare Shader Test framework, describing how tests are written for shader code. The talk will also delve into the C++ and HLSL implementation of the shader testing framework to discuss the design goals of the system, and how we are using C++ to meet these design goals.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling with Boolean Implication with Ben Deane </strong>(Intel) &#8211; Message reception and dispatch is something common to many codebases. This talk shows the unreasonable effectiveness of going back to basics and really understanding and unlocking the power of Boolean algebra in the design of a message handling library. We&#8217;ll talk about composing predicates on messages and manipulating them at compile time in order to do the least work when dispatching them at runtime. Particularly we&#8217;ll introduce implication, develop an intuition for this lesser-used Boolean operation, and see how it is key to a generic approach for simplifying predicates.</li>
<li><strong>I Embedded a Programming Language In Debug Information with Sy Brand</strong> (Microsoft) &#8211; DWARF information on Linux provides debuggers with a bridge between high-level source code and the machine instructions generated by the compiler. As part of this, it describes how to locate variables within your program at runtime using a language called DWARF Expressions. When implementing a parser for DWARF Expressions I thought &#8220;this seems suspiciously Turing-complete, can I implement a programming language inside this?&#8221; It turns out the answer is yes. In this session you&#8217;ll learn how debug information and executables are stored on Linux systems and how I managed to (ab)use them to implement a programming language interpreter that runs when you ask your debugger for the address of a variable.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing C++ development with Copilot Chat with Sinem Akinci</strong> (Microsoft) &#8211; Copilot is an AI-powered pair programmer integrated into Visual Studio and VS Code that can be there to assist you at many different points in your C++ development journey. In this session, we’ll introduce Copilot and Copilot Chat, share tips for achieving the results you want, and provide different use cases for using these tools. Then, we’ll see these tools in action in C++ code in Visual Studio as we tackle a variety of problems from navigating and understanding code to refactoring existing code.</li>
<li><strong>Progress Report: Adopting Header Units in Microsoft Word with Zachary Henkel</strong> (Microsoft) &#8211; Microsoft Office is a huge C++ codebase with nearly 100 million lines of native code. This size provides a constant challenge to build the product as quickly as possible. C++20 header units are a way to receive many of the benefits of modules, while still working with a codebase originally designed for classic header inclusion. At CppCon 2022 we announced that Office would investigate header units with the goal of improved build throughput. We’re excited to present the results of that work for the benefit of the C++ community at large. In this session, we’ll share build performance metrics for the first time.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post summarizes changes to the <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg package manager</a> as part of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2024.03.19">2024.03.19</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2024.03.25">2024.03.25</a> releases as well as changes to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/">vcpkg documentation</a> throughout March. This month’s vcpkg release includes an arm64ec platform expression, more flexibility when mixing static and dynamic libraries, diagnostics improvements, a change in the binary caching ABI calculation, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Some stats for this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now <strong>2,415 total libraries</strong> available in the vcpkg public registry.</li>
<li><strong>21 new ports</strong> were added to the open-source registry. A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/ports">port is a versioned recipe</a> for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.</li>
<li><strong>405 updates</strong> were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/triplets">triplets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>32 contributors</strong> submitted PRs, issues, or participated in discussions in the main repo.</li>
<li>The main vcpkg repo has over <strong>5,900 forks</strong> and <strong>21,200 stars</strong> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="vcpkg-changelog-2024-03-19-2024-03-25-releases">vcpkg changelog (2024.03.19 + 2024.03.25 releases)</h3>
<p>Several improvements to diagnostics output. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default"># Before
.\vcpkg.exe install zlib:x64-windows[core]
&lt;unknown&gt;:1:17: error: expected eof on expression: zlib:x64-windows[core]
                                                                   ^
vcpkg install &lt;port name&gt; &lt;port name&gt;...
vcpkg install zlib zlib:x64-windows curl boost

# After
.\vcpkg.exe install zlib:x64-windows[core]
error: expected the end of input parsing a package spec; did you mean zlib[core]:x64-windows instead?
on expression: zlib:x64-windows[core]
                               ^</code><code></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Added an arm64ec platform expression to assist with creating triplets targeting arm64ec (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1352</a>, thanks @autoantwort!).</li>
<li>Removed the warning about the default triplet change that was implemented in a previous release (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1351">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1351</a>).</li>
<li>DLLs can now be used in static triplets if BuildPolicy::DLLS_IN_STATIC_LIBRARY is turned on. Those DLLs should still have CRT and architecture checked. Static libraries can also now be in dynamic triplets if their CRT linkage matches (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1358</a>).</li>
<li>New behavior: vcpkg will output a message with the path to the compiler it is using in certain cases where there is ambiguity about the compiler version (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1328">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1328</a>).</li>
<li>Installing ports with &#8211;only-downloads will no longer affect the ABI calculation used by the binary caching feature (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1363</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug fixes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a vcpkg command to exit prematurely if a ‘)’ character was present in certain path assignments (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1354">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1354</a>, thanks @jcbrill!).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing certain versioning schemes from working with the versioning overrides feature (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1329">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1329</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that broke binary caching for the Meson tool port (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/37585">Microsoft/vcpkg#37585</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when running vcpkg install against a manifest with a non-existent port and version override. (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/36994">Microsoft/vcpkg#36994</a>, thanks @dforsten!).</li>
<li>Various other minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Visual Studio 2022 17.10 Preview 2, we’re including a small quality-of-life improvement that results in the Watch/Locals window displaying local variables correctly for any arbitrary frames in the call stack in debug builds. To try it out, please install the recently released Preview. For more information, read on. </p>
<h4 id="the-problem-missing-variables-in-watch-window">The problem: missing variables in Watch Window</h4>
<p>Have you ever been in this situation? We’re debugging some code, and have a breakpoint we hit in a function, <em>foo</em>. We need to inspect the values of some local variables a bit up the call stack, so we open up the call stack window and click to that frame. </p>
<p>In this case, we want to see the value of the variable <em>y</em>, which is an input to calculate the argument to the function foo we’re inspecting. Unfortunately, it’s not available:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33769 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a.png" alt="variable y is not available" width="975" height="727" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a.png 975w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-300x224.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-768x573.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>The reason it isn’t available has to do with scoping, and how call stacks are walked. The variable <em>y</em> is scoped to just that one if statement; when you’re outside the if block, <em>y</em> no longer exists. And, the way call stacks work, the return address we use to determine the scope is actually the next instruction after the call, or in this case, the <em>return</em> statement.</p>
<h4 id="improvements-to-variable-visibility">Improvements to variable visibility</h4>
<p>In Visual Studio 2022 17.10 Preview 2, we’ve addressed this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/VS-Debugger-CC-watch-doesnt-have-acc/10445086">Community Suggestion</a>. Now, in this toy example, you will see the value of the variable <em>y</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33772 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-1.png" alt="variable y is available" width="975" height="727" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-1.png 975w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-1-300x224.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-1-768x573.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>The breakpoint is in the same location, but now when you click to the previous frame, you’ll see the “next statement” arrow still points to the call, so all the variables in that scope are now available.</p>
<p>How did we do this? Well, there are a ton of approaches we could have taken, but the one we went with was to change the code generation of debug builds to include <em>nop</em> instructions after every call which ends a lexical scope (and only calls which are the final instruction in a scope).</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33773 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-2.png" alt="nop inserted after call" width="974" height="580" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-2.png 974w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-2-300x179.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-2-768x457.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></a></p>
<p>The extra <em>nop</em> instruction after the call to <em>foo</em> is what makes this work. It’s located in the same scope, so everything works as expected without having to modify the debugger or the stack walking algorithm. This has the advantage of also working on older debuggers.</p>
<p>This approach does increase the code size generated in Debug builds, so should something go wrong, we’ve added a switch to disable this behavior. Just add <strong>/d2EnsureCallScopeForDebugging-</strong> to the “Additional Options” under the Command Line for your project, and you’ll get the previous behavior of not generating extra <em>nops</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-3.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33774 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-3.png" alt="command line option added to disable this feature" width="975" height="685" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-3.png 975w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-3-300x211.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/a-3-768x540.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>This switch may be removed in the future.</p>
<h4 id="send-us-your-feedback">Send us your feedback</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce that Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 is now generally available! This post summarizes the new features you can find in this release for C++. You can download Visual Studio 2022 from the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio downloads page </a>or upgrade your existing installation by following the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/update-visual-studio?view=vs-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Update Visual Studio Learn page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="standard-library">Standard Library</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re continuing to improve our open source <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL">standard library implementation</a>. Thank you to everyone who has contributed features and fixes to this release! You can find the full set of changes at the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog">STL changelog</a>.</p>
<p>The main conformance highlight for this release is the implementation of the <code>&lt;mdspan&gt;</code> header. This provides support for multi-dimensional views of data. You can read WG21 paper <a href="https://wg21.link/P0009R18" rel="nofollow">P0009R18</a> for details and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/mdspan">cppreference page</a> for documentation on how to use it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made progress on the implementation of <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2286r8.html">P2286 Formatting Ranges</a>. This work will continue into version 17.10.</p>
<p>Outside of conformance, you&#8217;ll also find improved performance for some algorithms. For example, we optimized the <code>copy()</code>, <code>copy_n()</code>, and <code>move()</code> algorithms for <code>vector&lt;bool&gt;</code> iterators, with speedups varying from 1.8x (times, not percent) to 3200x (not a typo), depending on the size and alignment of the bits being copied.</p>

<h2 id="streamlined-unreal-engine-blueprints-references">Streamlined Unreal Engine Blueprints References</h2>
<p>Available gradually over the upcoming weeks, you will no longer need the Visual Studio Unreal Engine plugin to see Blueprint References, and Visual Studio will now display CodeLens hints with reduced latency and use fewer machine resources. Additionally, we have added support for including usages of UFUNCTIONs outside of the class hierarchy directly in the CodeLens results. We will cache your results from previous scans and only process new or modified assets since the last scan.</p>
<h2 id="improved-intellisense-for-unreal-engine-projects">Improved IntelliSense for Unreal Engine projects</h2>
<p>Unreal Engine uses its own reflection mechanism to connect the worlds of C++ and Blueprints. This is achieved through custom preprocessing of C++ sources with the Unreal Header Tool (UHT) and injection through the regular C++ preprocessor. We have improved the handling of Unreal Engine IntelliSense by ensuring consistency and accuracy. IntelliSense will now refresh more readily for UHT generated files, reducing the likelihood of displaying unwarranted errors.</p>

<h2 id="c-memory-layout-visualization">C++ Memory Layout Visualization</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-tools-to-display-c-class-memory-la/392536?q=memory+layout">your feedback</a> we have added the<strong> Memory Layout</strong> feature. This feature enables visualization of the memory arrangements for your classes, structs, and unions directly within your editor, removing the need for compilation to view these layouts. When you hover over your types, a “Memory Layout” link will appear within the Quick Info. Clicking this link will open a dedicated window displaying the memory layout of the selected type. Furthermore, hovering over individual data types within this window will provide detailed information about their size and offset within the type.</p>

<h2 id="include-diagnostics">#include Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Visual Studio now introduces <strong>#include Diagnostics</strong>, which provides a detailed analysis of your #include directives by displaying their references and build time. Once you turn on this feature, the number of references will be displayed in CodeLens. From there, you can easily navigate to the list of references and locate each reference. To view the build time of your #include directives next to their references, you will need to run Build Insights by navigating to Build &gt; Run Build Insights.</p>
