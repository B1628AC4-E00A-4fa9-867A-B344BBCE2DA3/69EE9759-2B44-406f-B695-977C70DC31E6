										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2026-insiders-is-here/">Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0</a> getting closer to General Availability (GA), we want to share with you how you can upgrade your projects from your current versions of Visual Studio and the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools to the latest versions. The new IDE ships with the <strong>v145 platform toolset</strong> for MSBuild C++ projects and <strong>MSVC Build Tools version 14.50</strong>. In this post, I will walk you through the process step-by-step, while explaining some of the features available to you to make the transition as painless as possible. Overall, our goal is to help you <strong>get current and stay current</strong>.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Try out Visual Studio 2026</h2>
<p>As of <em>September 9, 2025</em>, you can <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders</a>. Once the stable release of Visual Studio 2026 ships, you will be able to download it from the same link. You can choose between <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/">Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise</a> as before. <strong>Visual Studio instances can be installed side-by-side</strong> from the <em>Visual Studio Installer</em> application, so you can keep your current version of Visual Studio while exploring 2026.</p>
<p>If you are not ready to fully migrate yet, you can <strong>load your existing Visual Studio MSBuild (.sln/.vcxproj) projects in Visual Studio 2026</strong> and retain compatibility with your existing copy of Visual Studio without having to upgrade the project files.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Migrate to Visual Studio 2026, stay on existing MSVC Build Tools</h2>
<p>If you’re satisfied with your Visual Studio 2026 experience and are ready to use it daily, you can do so without needing to use the latest MSVC Build Tools. The installer for Visual Studio 2026 gives you the ability to <strong>install your existing C++ build tools</strong> going back as far as Visual Studio 2015. You can select multiple components/versions to include for your Visual Studio instance.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="744" height="636" class="wp-image-35861" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.webp" alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.webp 744w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-300x256.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>However, there is an even easier way to get started in Visual Studio 2026 and stay on your existing MSVC toolset version.</p>
<h3>Install missing tools with Visual Studio setup assistant</h3>
<p>You can use the <strong>new</strong> <strong>setup assistant </strong>experience to <strong>install missing tools and/or retarget any projects</strong> that are ready to move forward. You do not have to install and upgrade everything all at once.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1436" height="780" class="wp-image-35862" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.webp" alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.webp 1436w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1-300x163.webp 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1-1024x556.webp 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1-768x417.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /></p>
<p>This assistant will appear by default when you load your solution for the first time, or you can right-click the solution and select<em> Retarget solution</em>. To stay on a project’s existing toolset version and install any missing tools, choose the “Install missing Platform Toolset…” option. You can also click the <em>Install All</em> button to instantly set all the dropdowns to that option. If you already have the correct toolset version installed and want to stay on it, no action needs to be taken.</p>
<p>You will also see options to retarget your projects. You can go back and select these later when you are ready to move your projects and toolset version forward to the latest. Retargeting will update the <em>Windows SDK Version</em>, <em>Platform Toolset</em>, and <em>MSVC Build Tools Version</em> project properties. You may select what to do for each project or retarget all of them at once with the <em>Retarget all</em> button.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamentally,</strong> <strong>the setup assistant allows you to upgrade gradually at your own pace</strong>.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Upgrade MSVC Build Tools to version 14.50</h2>
<p>When you decide it’s the right time to upgrade and explore the latest MSVC toolset, the process is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Visual Studio aims to support you to get current and stay current on the latest tools.</p>
<h3>Why you should upgrade your C++ build tools</h3>
<p>By upgrading, you get access to new <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-language-updates-in-msvc-build-tools-v14-50/">C++ language updates and bug fixes in the Microsoft C++ compiler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog">standard library</a>. In addition, if you upgrade, you get runtime performance improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>+6%</strong>, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1050" height="426" class="wp-image-35863" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-ai-generated-content-may-be-inco.webp" alt="A graph of a bar AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-ai-generated-content-may-be-inco.webp 1050w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-ai-generated-content-may-be-inco-300x122.webp 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-ai-generated-content-may-be-inco-1024x415.webp 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-ai-generated-content-may-be-inco-768x312.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>+3%</strong>, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1066" height="426" class="wp-image-35864" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-chart-ai-generated-content-may-b.webp" alt="A graph of a bar chart AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-chart-ai-generated-content-may-b.webp 1066w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-chart-ai-generated-content-may-b-300x120.webp 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-chart-ai-generated-content-may-b-1024x409.webp 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-graph-of-a-bar-chart-ai-generated-content-may-b-768x307.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px" /></p>
<h3>Retarget your projects with the setup assistant</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, the setup assistant can help you retarget your projects, so they build with the latest MSVC Build Tools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1444" height="824" class="wp-image-35865" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-ai-generated-c.webp" alt="A screenshot of a computer program AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-ai-generated-c.webp 1444w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-ai-generated-c-300x171.webp 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-ai-generated-c-1024x584.webp 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-ai-generated-c-768x438.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1444px) 100vw, 1444px" /></p>
<p>Below is a quick video demonstration of the setup assistant in action to install missing tools and retarget projects.</p>
<p><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-35857-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>There are the new MSVC components in the Visual Studio Installer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="378" height="152" class="wp-image-35866" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-black-screen-with-white-text-ai-generated-conte.webp" alt="A black screen with white text AI-generated content may be incorrect." srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-black-screen-with-white-text-ai-generated-conte.webp 378w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/a-black-screen-with-white-text-ai-generated-conte-300x121.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>Components marked as “Latest” will be updated to the latest available version when you update the IDE, while components with a major and minor version number will remain on that minor version and only receive servicing updates while in support.</p>
<h3>C++ binary compatibility for step-by-step upgrades</h3>
<p>We’re announcing that <strong>MSVC Build Tools version 14.50 preserves binary compatibility</strong> with any code built with MSVC tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 or later. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and external dependencies all at once. The <strong>Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable</strong>, which ships the <strong>Visual C++ v14 Runtime</strong>, also continues to maintain this binary compatibility. Note: there are a few restrictions with the binary compatibility experience, which you should review <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017">in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this binary compatibility, <strong>you can upgrade your code step-by-step, component by component</strong>. You can also update your main application while your external dependencies remain on an older version. For your third party open-source dependencies, you can use the <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg package manager</a> to rebuild them with the latest toolset or any previous MSVC toolset shipping in Visual Studio 2026.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++</h2>
<p>But wait, there’s more! <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/new-github-copilot-capabilities-for-c-developers-upgrade-msvc-improve-build-performance-and-refactor-c-code/#upgrade-msvc-with-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-c++">GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++</a> helps you migrate your C++ projects to the latest MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, you may need to make additional source code or project system changes due to deprecations or fixes in the newer toolset. Copilot will help you iterate through these changes until all warnings and errors are resolved. GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is coming soon to Visual Studio 2026 in Private Preview. Check out our announcement post for more information and <a href="https://aka.ms/cpp-agents-private-preview">join the waitlist</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday at GitHub Universe, GitHub announced support for custom agents. <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-custom-agents-for-github-copilot/?utm_source=web-k2k-custom-agents-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=universe25">Custom agents</a> are specialized configurations with custom prompts and context that focus Copilot on specific development tasks.</p>
<p>On the C++ team, we have a similar goal: Provide differentiated capabilities that optimize GitHub Copilot for C++ development tasks. As a first step towards this goal, we’re announcing <strong>new capabilities for GitHub Copilot that support C++ developers in three development tasks: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools</li>
<li>Improve C++ build performance</li>
<li>Perform large-scale C++ refactors</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences will be available soon as a Private Preview in Visual Studio 2026. <a href="https://aka.ms/cpp-agents-private-preview">Join the waitlist for Private Preview today</a>.</p>
<h2>Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++</h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot’s app modernization capabilities help you migrate your C++ projects to a newer version of the MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, it’s possible that additional source code or project system changes will be needed due to deprecations or fixes in the newer version of MSVC. Copilot will help you iterate through these changes until all warnings and errors are resolved.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eCFb_VyNMWU" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Improve C++ build performance with GitHub Copilot build performance for Windows</h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot&#8217;s build performance capabilities analyze your C++ build and suggest changes to improve build performance. This agent can, for example, create a precompiled header for expensive #include files, or adjust function inlining (<code>__forceinline</code>) to address bottlenecks in your build.</p>
<h2>Perform large-scale C++ refactors with C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot</h2>
<p>C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot expose the power of C++ IntelliSense to GitHub Copilot. This suite of tools improves the accuracy and performance of C++ code editing queries. You can interact with these tools directly in Copilot Chat, or create <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/boost-your-copilot-collaboration-with-reusable-prompt-files/">prompt files</a> to facilitate more complex, codebase-wide refactoring tasks.</p>
<h2>Thank you for your feedback</h2>
<p>We’re excited to build alongside you and deliver new capabilities that make GitHub Copilot even more valuable for C++ developers. We’ve already engaged with internal Microsoft developers, and we’re now rolling these experiences out in Private Preview to prioritize deeper customer feedback from a wide range of C++ customers.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about these new capabilities, <a href="https://aka.ms/cpp-agents-private-preview">sign up for the Private Preview waitlist</a> and stay tuned for more information on the C++ team blog. If you have general feedback on Visual Studio 2026, you can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022">file an issue or suggestion</a> on Developer Community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post summarizes changes to the <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg package manager</a> as part of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2025.09.17">2025.09.17</a> registry release, the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/releases/tag/2025-08-29">2025-08-29</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/releases/tag/2025-09-03">2025-09-03</a> tool releases, as well as changes to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/">vcpkg documentation</a> throughout September. This month’s updates includes new binary caching sources <code>x-azcopy</code> and <code>x-azcopy-sas</code>, support for tvOS and watchOS target platforms, and minor improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Some stats for this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now <strong>2,673 total ports </strong>available in the vcpkg curated registry. A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/ports">port is a versioned recipe</a> for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.</li>

<h2>vcpkg changelog (2025.09.17 release)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for tvOS and watchOS target platforms (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1747">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1747</a>, thanks @wkornewald!).</li>
<li>Added two new binary caching sources that interact with Azure Storage blob containers using the <em>azcopy</em> executable:
<ul>
<li><code>x-azcopy-sas,&lt;url&gt;,&lt;sas&gt;[,&lt;rw&gt;]</code>: Intended as a drop-in replacement for azblob, it uses SAS tokens for authentication.</li>
<li><code>x-azcopy,&lt;url&gt;[,&lt;rw&gt;]</code>: Intended for non-SAS authentication methods like Microsoft Entra ID; requires preloading credentials and/or the <code>AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE</code>.</li>
<li>Internally, we use the <code>azcopy copy --from-to BlobLocal {destination} --include-path {files}</code> argument to download multiple files in a single azcopy job. This improves performance and brings it more in line with azblob, that uses a single curl invocation to download a batch of files. Upload happens one file at a time in the background.</li>
<li>(PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1738">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1738</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new option <code>--dereference-symlinks</code> to <code>vcpkg export</code>. This copies symlinks as regular files and directories in the exported results, which can be useful to continuous integration systems needing to restore vcpkg’s install tree (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1705">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1705</a>).</li>
<li>Added new vcpkg.json property: <code>configuration</code>. This is an alias for the <code>vcpkg-configuration</code> property, allowing you to embed vcpkg configuration properties that would otherwise have been specified in a separate vcpkg-configuration.json file (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1766">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1766</a>).</li>
<li>Added installed package files to SPDX SBOM files generated by vcpkg and removed repetition of relationships that is no longer present in v3 of the SPDX spec (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1744">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1744</a>, thanks @ekilmer!).</li>
<li>vcpkg no longer restores the original “last updated” times for restored files during binary caching operations on Windows to resolve issues where a build tool is expecting headers and binaries to have similar last updated times but thinks the restored binaries are too old. This was already previously fixed on Linux systems (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1750">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1750</a>, thanks @autoantwort!).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where vcpkg was failing to detect conflicting installed files when the installed content has capital letters (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1768">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1768</a>).</li>
<li>Other minor improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/reference/vcpkg-json#configuration">documentation</a> for <code>configuration</code> field in <em>vcpkg.json</em> files. (PR: <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs/pull/527">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#527</a>).</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/commands/export#--dereference-symlinks">documentation</a> for <code>--dereference-symlinks</code> option for vcpkg export (PR: <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs/pull/524">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#524</a>).</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/reference/binarycaching#configuration-syntax">documentation</a> for <code>x-azcopy</code> and <code>x-azcopy-sas</code> binary caching sources (PR: <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs/pull/511">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#511</a>).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In the below discussion, </span><code style="font-size: 16px;">.NET Framework</code><span style="font-size: 16px;"> refers to the older version </span>of the Microsoft Common Language Runtime, also known as &#8220;Desktop Framework&#8221; (versions 4.0 through 4.8.x) while <code>.NET</code>  refers to versions <code>.NET Core 3.1</code>, <code>.NET 5</code> and later.</p>
<p>The overload resolution behavior specified by the C++/CLI ECMA-372
Standard for overloads involving parameter arrays results in surprising
behavior in some instances. This problem has manifested with recent
versions of .NET, which added parameter array overloads to some
commonly used classes, resulting in overload resolution which is
surprising, even counterintuitive, and results in broken customer code
when it is ported from .NET Framework to .NET. This article
explains the problem and the solution adopted by the MSVC
compiler to solve it.</p>
<h2>Recap of Parameter Array Overload Resolution Rules</h2>
<p>ECMA-372 section 14.6 details the rules governing overload resolution
where parameter arrays are involved. The method to resolve overloads is
that for a given parameter-array overload such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">    void f(T1 arg1, T2 arg2, &lt;...&gt;, Tm argm, ...array&lt;T&gt;^ arr);</code></pre>
<p>and a corresponding call</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">    f(var1, var2, &lt;...&gt;, varm, val1, val2, &lt;...&gt;, valn);</code></pre>
<p>a new function overload is synthesized, where the parameter array <code>arr</code>
is replaced with parameters corresponding to the types of the formal
arguments <code>val1, val2 ... valn</code>. Then, overload resolution is performed
as usual with the additional requirement that such synthesized overloads
have lower cost than a C-style variadic function (i.e., those using
<code>...</code> as the last argument) but higher cost than non-synthesized
overloads. This requirement is in fact the cause of surprising behavior
described below.</p>
<h2>Customer Reports Previously Working Code is Broken</h2>
<p>In .NET Framework, the <code>String</code> class has these methods (type names
are from namespace <code>System</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">      Split(...array&lt;Char&gt;^);               // 1 (parameter array overload)   
      // other Split overloads not of interest</code></pre>
<p>Given a function call such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">      str-&gt;Split(L'a', L'b');               // 2</code></pre>
<p>the <code>Split</code> overload (2) with the parameter array argument is the only
one that matches. When this same code is compiled against .NET, a
customer found that a different overload is instead chosen. The reason
is subtle, surprising and a combination of questionable overload
resolution rules in ECMA-372 and changes to the <code>String</code> class in .NET.</p>
<p>The difference between .NET Framework&#8217;s version of <code>String</code> and .NET&#8217;s version is that .NET added an additional overload, leading
to this set of overloads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">      Split(Char, Int32, StringSplitOptions = StringSplitOptions::None); // 3
      Split(...array&lt;Char&gt;^);                                            // 4          </code></pre>
<p>Now faced with the same function call (2) above, we see that both
overloads are viable because C++ has an implicit <code>Char</code> (aka <code>wchar_t</code>) to
<code>Int32</code> (aka <code>int</code>) conversion, and the third parameter of (3) has a default
argument. Due to the rule in ECMA-372/14.6, the parameter array overload
(4) is deemed to have a higher cost and overload (3) is chosen, <em>even
though the arguments match the parameters exactly for overload (4)</em>.
This is clearly not what the user wanted.</p>
<h2>Microsoft C++ Solution</h2>
<p>After discussion in the team, we noticed that there is a telling comment
in ECMA-372/14.6 regarding preferring non-synthesized to synthesized
overloads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[<em>Note</em>: This is similar to the tiebreaker rules for template
functions and non-template functions in the C++ Standard (§13.3.3).
<em>end note</em>]&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While the tie-breaking rule in ISO C++ does indeed exist, <em>it comes into
play only after overload resolution is done and the choice is between
two overloads, one a generated function and one a non-template
function</em>. It looked like the ECMA-372 rule for choosing non-synthesized
over synthesized was poorly formulated as it assigned the latter a
higher cost regardless of the costs of the conversion sequences of the
arguments.</p>
<p>In ISO C++, an analogous example would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    void Split(T, T);               // 5
    void Split(wchar_t, int);       // 6</code></pre>
<p>The function call <code>Split(L’a’, L’b’)</code> will resolve to overload (5) since
the arguments match exactly while one of the arguments of (6) requires a
standard integral conversion. Hence, there is no need to use the
tie-breaking rule at all. Were both formal arguments of (6) of type <code>wchar_t</code>, the
tie-breaking rule would indeed come into play and choose (6) instead of
giving an ambiguity error.</p>
<p>It became clear that ECMA-372/14.6 should have said if there is an
ambiguity between two remaining overloads, one a synthesized parameter
array overload, and one a non-synthesized overload, overload resolution
would choose the non-synthesized one. We decided to implement this
updated interpretation but there was a problem: what to do about the
code currently compiling and working correctly with the older rules?</p>
<p>The risk of breaking older code was too great if we went unconditionally
with the new rules, so we added two mechanisms to control this behavior
at the compilation unit level, and whenever needed, at the function-call
level.</p>
<p>First, we introduced new driver switches:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>/clr:ECMAParamArray</code></td>
<td>Turn on ECMA-372 conformant parameter array behavior</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/clr:ECMAParamArray-</code></td>
<td>Use updated semantics for parameter arrays</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition, the below existing driver switches were changed to imply these
corresponding modes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>/clr</code></td>
<td>implies <code>/clr:ECMAParamArray</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/clr:netcore</code></td>
<td>implies <code>/clr:ECMAParamArray-</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In plain language, for compilations targeting .NET Framework, we
maintain the old behavior, while for compilations targeting .NET, the
new behavior is the default.</p>
<p>To allow fine-grained control over the parameter array overload
resolution mode at the function-call level, we provide a new pragma,
<code>ecma_paramarray</code>, which can be used thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">    #pragma ecma_paramarray(push, on)
        // Normally calls Split(Char, int32, StringSplitOptions = None) and
        // not Split(...array&lt;Char&gt;^) under /clr:netcore but this is
        // reverted back to the old behavior under the pragma.
        auto r = s-&gt;Split(L'a', L'b'); 
    #pragma ecma_paramarray(pop)</code></pre>
<p>This pragma overrides any ambient mode for handling parameter array
overload resolution, whether it comes from a prior pragma use or from
the translation unit&#8217;s ambient mode.</p>
<p>To warn about changed behavior in overload resolution, a new warning
<code>C5306</code> has been implemented. Consider compiling the below under <code>/clr:netcore</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">int main()
{
    System::String^ s = "Now is the time+for all good men|to come to the aid of the party";
    auto strings = s-&gt;Split(L'|', L'+');  // Split(params char[]), not Split(char, int, System.StringSplitOptions = 0)
}</code></pre>
<p>This produces the diagnostic:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">    auto strings = s-&gt;Split(L'|', L'+');  // Split(params char[]), not Split(char, int, System.StringSplitOptions = 0)
                      ^
w.cpp(4,23): warning C5306: parameter array behavior change: overload 'System::String::Split' resolved to 'array&lt;System::String ^&gt; ^System::String::Split(...array&lt;wchar_t&gt; ^)'; previously, it would have resolved to 'array&lt;System::String ^&gt; ^System::String::Split(wchar_t,int,System::StringSplitOptions)'. Use /clr:ECMAParamArray to revert to old behavior</code></pre>
<p>In addition, missing the <code>L</code> prefix for arguments can also produce
surprising results in overload resolution with the new parameter array
overload rules. A new warning <code>C5307</code> was implemented to warn about
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">int main()
{
    System::String^ s = "abc def\tghi";
    // Resolves to Split(System.Char, System.Int32, System.StringSplitOptions = 0) but should warn with C5307
    auto arrs = s-&gt;Split(' ', '\t');  // Should be Split(L' ', L'\t').
}</code></pre>
<p>produces</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">    auto arrs = s-&gt;Split(' ', '\t');  // Should be Split(L' ', L'\t').
                   ^
w.cpp(4,20): warning C5307: 'array&lt;System::String ^&gt; ^System::String::Split(wchar_t,int,System::StringSplitOptions)':
argument (2) converted from 'char' to 'int'. Missing 'L' encoding-prefix for character literal?</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We would be happy to hear back from you if you have encountered
problems in this area and how you solved them, and if the new way of
handling parameter array overloads has helped you or hindered you.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again! We are excited to see you all at <a href="https://www.cppcon.com">CppCon</a> this year, where <strong>we&#8217;ll once again be delivering a variety of presentations, from the latest advancements in debugging technology to extensibility frameworks for AI agents.</strong> See the end of this post for a listing of all of the sessions involving Microsoft staff. And yes, there&#8217;ll be plenty of information on the <a href="https://aka.ms/VS2026Insiders">freshly announced Visual Studio 2026</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ll also have a booth through the first four days of the conference.</strong> Come on by and let us know what matters to you or ask any burning questions you may have regarding C++ at Microsoft. We will be well stocked with our most popular swag, so come on by and have a chat with us. There may even be appearances by speakers in case you didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask that all important question after their session.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://aka.ms/cppcon/blog">annual survey</a> is now open and will be available all week throughout the conference. It&#8217;s super lightweight, and upon completion, CppCon attendees will be entered into a raffle for one of four great prizes. You do have to be onsite for the daily drawing to win (see <a href="https://aka.ms/cppcon/survey-official-rules">official rules here</a>), but even if you aren&#8217;t going to be at the conference, you can still complete the survey to let us know what you think of our C++ products. <strong>New this year on the survey is an option to select a dedicated time to talk with Microsoft staff about the topics you care about.</strong> So, if you don&#8217;t want to lose your voice in a crowded expo hall you can find that right time that fits into your busy schedule.</p>
<h2>Try out Visual Studio 2026 Insiders &#8211; <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/insiders">Get Started Here</a></h2>
<p>Visual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools v14.50 Preview are already available on the Insiders Channel (which replaces the previous Visual Studio 2022 Preview channel), with a Stable Channel going live later in 2025.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>C++ Language Updates in MSVC Build Tools v14.50</h3>
<p>It has been some time since we have provided an update on MSVC progress, and this one comes with the latest major update to our IDE: <strong>Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0</strong>. This version of Visual Studio ships with the <strong>MSVC Build Tools version 14.50</strong>, which includes version 19.50 of the MSVC compiler. You can try out the improvements by <a href="https://aka.ms/vspreview">downloading the Insiders release</a>. Also, if you want to track updates in the Standard Library, check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog">STL Changelog</a>, which is regularly updated. Let’s jump right into the updates!</p>
<h2>C++23 Features</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post summarizes changes to the <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg package manager</a> as part of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2025.08.27">2025.08.27</a> registry release as well as changes to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/">vcpkg documentation</a> throughout August. There were no tool changes as of the date of the registry release in August, though more changes will be listed in the next release in September.</p>
<p>Some stats for this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now <strong>2,666 total ports </strong>available in the vcpkg curated registry. A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/ports">port is a versioned recipe</a> for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.</li>
<li><strong>14 new ports</strong> were added to the curated registry.</li>
<li><strong>240 ports were updated</strong>. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/triplets">triplets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>86 </strong>community contributors made commits.</li>
<li>The main vcpkg repo has over <strong>7,000 forks</strong> and <strong>25,500 stars</strong> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, we announced <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/dependabot-support-for-vcpkg/">GitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg</a>. This allows GitHub users to receive automated PRs to upgrade their vcpkg versioning baselines. Since that announcement, the automated PRs have been updated to include information about the vcpkg release being upgraded to, including port counts per triplet, as well as a list of impacted ports and their original vs. new versions. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/14417">Here is an example of one of the new PRs</a>.</p>
<h2>vcpkg changelog (2025.08.27 release)</h2>
<p>No tool updates as of 2025.08.27. More tool updates will be included in next month’s release.</p>
<h2>Documentation changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added documentation covering <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/dependabot">Dependabot support for vcpkg</a> (PR: <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs/pull/512">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#512</a>, thanks @JamieMagee!).</li>
<li>Other minor documentation fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any suggestions for our documentation, please <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/issues">submit an issue in our GitHub repo</a> or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Version 4 of Microsoft's Proxy library brings feature improvements, better diagnostics, better code generation, modern compiler/debugger support.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/announcing-proxy-4-the-next-leap-in-c-polymorphism/">Announcing Proxy 4: The Next Leap in C++ Polymorphism</a> appeared first on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog">C++ Team Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proxy 4 is here! After years of innovation and sustained use in the Windows OS codebase (since 2022), Proxy has matured from a bold experiment into a production-grade, modern C++ library for runtime polymorphism. The theory behind Proxy is original, and its design is now proven at scale. We are excited to invite the broader C++ community to join us in shaping the future of polymorphism. Your ideas and contributions are more welcome than ever!</p>
<p>A special thank you to @SidneyCogdill for his outstanding contributions, especially for bringing support for C++20 modules to Proxy and driving major‑version compatibility efforts. His work has made the library even more accessible and future‑proof.</p>
<h2>What is Proxy?</h2>
<p>Proxy is a header-only, cross-platform C++20 library that lets you write polymorphic code without the pain of inheritance or the limitations of traditional virtual functions. Proxy enables you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write code that is portable, non-intrusive, and easy to maintain</li>
<li>Manage object lifetimes flexibly, with or without ownership</li>
<li>Achieve performance that rivals or exceeds hand-written code</li>
<li>Compose abstractions from any expression: member functions, free functions, operators, conversions, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to Proxy, check out our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/proxy">GitHub repository</a> and our previous announcements: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/announcing-the-proxy-3-library-for-dynamic-polymorphism/">Announcing the Proxy 3 Library for Dynamic Polymorphism</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/analyzing-the-performance-of-the-proxy-library/">Analyzing the Performance of the &#8220;Proxy&#8221; Library</a>.</p>
<h2>New Website: Your One-Stop Reference</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve launched a new documentation website, built with MkDocs, to help you find everything you need about Proxy. The new site offers improved navigation, a unified FAQ, and a clear structure for all features and APIs. Explore the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/">documentation</a> and discover how easy it is to get started!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/index.png" alt="Index" /></p>
<h2>Try Proxy Instantly in Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p>You can now experiment with Proxy directly in your browser using <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/E95nY7PYq">Compiler Explorer</a>! Write, run, and inspect Proxy code without any setup. Just click on &#8220;Libraries&#8221; and search for &#8220;proxy&#8221; in Compiler Explorer or use a shared link from our examples to get started. It&#8217;s a great way to see Proxy in action and share your findings with others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/compiler-explorer.png" alt="Compiler Explorer" /></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s New in Proxy 4?</h2>
<h3>Skills: Composable Facade Capabilities</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how easy it is to add formatting support to your types (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/3G363xz71">run in Compiler Explorer</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;format&gt;
#include &lt;proxy/proxy.h&gt;

struct Formattable : pro::facade_builder
    ::add_skill&lt;pro::skills::format&gt;
    ::build {};

int main() {
  pro::proxy&lt;Formattable&gt; p = pro::make_proxy&lt;Formattable&gt;(123);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::format("{}\n", *p); // Prints "123"
}</code></pre>
<p>Skills are reusable building blocks that let you add powerful capabilities to your facades with a single line:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_format/"><code>skills::format</code> and <code>skills::wformat</code></a>: Enable standard C++ formatting for your proxies. This was never possible with virtual functions or earlier Proxy versions.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_fmt_format/"><code>skills::fmt_format</code> and <code>skills::fmt_wformat</code></a>: Bring full <a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt">{fmt} library</a> support to your proxies, letting you use advanced formatting features with zero boilerplate.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_rtti/"><code>skills::rtti</code></a>: Add runtime type information and safe casting to your proxies.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_as_view/"><code>skills::as_view</code></a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_as_weak/"><code>skills::as_weak</code></a>: Allow seamless conversion to non-owning or weak proxies, making your code safer and more expressive.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/skills_slim/"><code>skills::slim</code></a>: Restrict your proxy to pointer-sized storage for maximum efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills are easy to compose and extend. You can also author internal, domain‑specific skills to capture patterns (logging, metrics hooks, validation, instrumentation) so teams reuse a single, well-reviewed definition instead of duplicating conventions. This improves consistency and long‑term maintainability. See the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/basic_facade_builder/add_skill/">skills documentation</a> for more.</p>
<h3>Easy Borrowing and Weak References</h3>
<p>Proxy 4 introduces convenient aliases for non-owning and weak references: <code>proxy_view</code> and <code>weak_proxy</code>. These are built on top of the core <code>proxy</code> concept, making it easier to express borrowing and weak ownership patterns in your code. For example, you can use <code>proxy_view</code> to safely borrow an object without taking ownership, or <code>weak_proxy</code> to create a weak reference that can be locked when needed. See the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxy_view/"><code>proxy_view</code> documentation</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/weak_proxy/"><code>weak_proxy</code> documentation</a> for details.</p>
<h3>Shared Ownership Made Simple</h3>
<p>With the new <code>make_proxy_shared</code> and <code>allocate_proxy_shared</code> APIs, you can create shared and weak proxies efficiently, without the overhead of <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. These APIs use compact internal pointer types, ensuring high performance and low memory usage. Learn more in the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/make_proxy_shared/"><code>make_proxy_shared</code> documentation</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/allocate_proxy_shared/"><code>allocate_proxy_shared</code> documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Smarter Dispatch and Conversion</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/weak_dispatch/"><code>weak_dispatch</code></a> lets you define fallback behavior for missing conventions, so your code can handle incomplete types gracefully.</li>
<li>Conversion dispatches (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/explicit_conversion_dispatch/"><code>explicit_conversion_dispatch</code></a>, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/implicit_conversion_dispatch/"><code>implicit_conversion_dispatch</code></a>) are now easier to use and provide clearer error messages.</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxiable_target/"><code>proxiable_target</code></a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/inplace_proxiable_target/"><code>inplace_proxiable_target</code></a> concepts make it clear which target types can be used with a given facade, helping you avoid surprises and write safer code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recursive Facade Patterns Made Easy</h2>
<p>Proxy 4 introduces <code>facade_aware_overload_t</code>, which lets you define recursive conventions that refer to the facade itself without forcing early instantiation. This is especially useful for operator chaining patterns (like arithmetic or concatenation) that return new <code>proxy</code> objects of the same facade. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;format&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;proxy/proxy.h&gt;

template &lt;class F&gt;
using BinaryOverload =
    pro::proxy&lt;F&gt;(const pro::proxy_indirect_accessor&lt;F&gt;&amp; rhs) const;

template &lt;class T, pro::facade F&gt;
pro::proxy&lt;F&gt; operator+(const T&amp; value,
                        const pro::proxy_indirect_accessor&lt;F&gt;&amp; rhs)
  requires(!std::is_same_v&lt;T, pro::proxy_indirect_accessor&lt;F&gt;&gt;)
{
  return pro::make_proxy&lt;F, T&gt;(value + proxy_cast&lt;const T&amp;&gt;(rhs));
}

struct Addable
    : pro::facade_builder              // Compose capabilities
      ::add_skill&lt;pro::skills::rtti&gt;   // RTTI support
      ::add_skill&lt;pro::skills::format&gt; // Formatting support
      ::add_convention&lt;pro::operator_dispatch&lt;"+"&gt;,
                       pro::facade_aware_overload_t&lt;BinaryOverload&gt;&gt; // Recursive operator
      ::build {};

int main() {
  pro::proxy&lt;Addable&gt; p1 = pro::make_proxy&lt;Addable&gt;(1);
  pro::proxy&lt;Addable&gt; p2 = pro::make_proxy&lt;Addable&gt;(2);
  pro::proxy&lt;Addable&gt; p3 = *p1 + *p2; // Uses facade-aware overload
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::format("{}\n", *p3); // Prints "3"
}</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/facade_aware_overload_t/"><code>facade_aware_overload_t</code> documentation</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Quality Improvements for Everyone</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitwise Trivially Relocatable</strong>: Proxy now supports types that can be moved with <code>memcpy</code>, enabling faster moves and assignments by default. This means better performance and less boilerplate for you. See the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/is_bitwise_trivially_relocatable/"><code>is_bitwise_trivially_relocatable</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>C++20 Modules Support</strong>: Thanks to @SidneyCogdill, Proxy now ships with <code>.ixx</code> files for blazing-fast builds and better IDE support.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Error messages are now much clearer and more actionable, helping you quickly understand and fix issues in your code.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging Experience</strong>: Proxy 4 generates better debugging symbols, making it easier to inspect proxies in your debugger and understand what&#8217;s happening under the hood.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Authoring</strong>: It&#8217;s now easier to expose reflection and dispatch capabilities in your facades, with less boilerplate and more flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Code Generation</strong>: Proxy 4 refines the call path for indirect dispatch, reducing the number of instructions around indirect calls.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler Support</strong>: NVIDIA HPC is newly added to our supported toolchains. Proxy 4 passes tests on the latest GCC, Clang, MSVC, and NVIDIA HPC compilers. We&#8217;re committed to keeping Proxy working with these compilers going forward, including freestanding environments. See the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/proxy#compiler-req">README</a> for minimum versions and flags.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Version Compatibility</h2>
<p>Upgrading a small component is usually straightforward, but migrating a monorepo or multi-module product can be challenging. Follow the guidelines below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minor or patch upgrades (e.g. 3.3.0 → 3.4.0)</strong>
All 3.x.y releases preserve API/ABI compatibility, so different parts of the program may safely depend on different 3.x.y versions. No special action is required.</li>
<li><strong>Major upgrades (e.g. 3.4.0 → 4.0.0)</strong>
<ul>
<li>If your current version is <em>earlier</em> than 3.4.0, migrate to 3.4.0 first.</li>
<li>Starting with 3.4.0, each major release is placed in a versioned inline namespace (<code>pro::v3</code>, <code>pro::v4</code>, …).  When a translation unit sees multiple majors, qualify the namespace explicitly:
<pre><code class="language-cpp">pro::v3::foo(); // Proxy 3 API
pro::v4::foo(); // Proxy 4 API</code></pre>
<p>The newest release re-exports its namespace as the inline (default) namespace, so unqualified calls (<code>pro::foo()</code>) resolve to the latest version once the migration is complete.</li>
<li>The macros also have major-qualified aliases, e.g. <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH/"><code>PRO4_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH</code></a>. Use these forms whenever headers from multiple majors are included in the same translation unit.</li>
<li>Upgrade subsystems incrementally, module-by-module or DLL-by-DLL. When every target depends only on the new major, drop the old include path and remove the previous version from your build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules let old and new code coexist during the transition while keeping ODR violations at bay.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The macro <code>PRO_DEF_WEAK_DISPATCH</code> has been removed in favor of the more flexible <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/weak_dispatch/"><code>weak_dispatch</code></a> class.</li>
<li>The class <code>proxiable_ptr_constraints</code> has been merged into the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/ProFacade/"><em>ProFacade</em> requirements</a> for simplicity.</li>
<li>The function template <code>access_proxy</code> is now shadowed by <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxy_invoke/"><code>proxy_invoke</code></a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxy_reflect/"><code>proxy_reflect</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/ProFacade/"><em>ProFacade</em></a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/ProDispatch/"><em>ProDispatch</em> requirements</a> have been revised for clarity and consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Proxy 4 builds on a mature foundation introduced and proven in Proxy 3, and adds focused refinements rather than reinventing the model.</p>
<p>Core capabilities (established in Proxy 3 and still central in day‑to‑day use):</p>
<ul>
<li>Expression‑based polymorphism: define a facade once, make virtually any expression (member calls, free calls, operators, explicit/implicit conversions) polymorphic.</li>
<li>Flexible creation: <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/make_proxy/"><code>make_proxy</code></a> (inline where possible), <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/allocate_proxy/"><code>allocate_proxy</code></a> (custom allocators), raw pointer attachment, unique ownership, and composition of abstractions via <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/basic_facade_builder/add_convention/"><code>add_convention</code></a> / <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/basic_facade_builder/add_reflection/"><code>add_reflection</code></a> / <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/basic_facade_builder/add_facade/"><code>add_facade</code></a>.</li>
<li>Lifetime versatility in a single <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxy/"><code>proxy</code></a> type: same facade supports non‑owning, unique, inline, or externally managed objects transparently.</li>
<li>Overload resolution &amp; reflection support for concise, generic call sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Targeted Proxy 4 refinements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergonomic aliases for borrowing / weak observation (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxy_view/"><code>proxy_view</code></a>, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/weak_proxy/"><code>weak_proxy</code></a>) built atop the existing core.</li>
<li>Skill-based composition (formatting, RTTI, view/weak conversion, slim layout, {fmt} integration) to replace repetitive convention boilerplate.</li>
<li>New shared/weak creation helpers (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/make_proxy_shared/"><code>make_proxy_shared</code></a>, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/allocate_proxy_shared/"><code>allocate_proxy_shared</code></a>) complement (not replace) the more frequently used <code>make_proxy</code> / <code>allocate_proxy</code> paths.</li>
<li>Concepts (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/proxiable_target/"><code>proxiable_target</code></a>, <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/inplace_proxiable_target/"><code>inplace_proxiable_target</code></a>) clarify when a type can be used with <code>make_proxy</code> versus <code>make_proxy_inplace</code>, giving earlier, sharper diagnostics instead of template noise.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/facade_aware_overload_t/"><code>facade_aware_overload_t</code></a> enables recursive facade/operator definitions (e.g. arithmetic that returns the same facade) without forcing premature instantiation.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/weak_dispatch/"><code>weak_dispatch</code></a> for graceful fallback when some contained types omit a convention.</li>
<li>Improved diagnostics, relocation optimizations (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/spec/is_bitwise_trivially_relocatable/"><code>is_bitwise_trivially_relocatable</code></a>), module support, and leaner code generation.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that GitHub’s Dependabot now brings <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-12-dependabot-version-updates-now-support-vcpkg/">automated dependency updates to C++ projects using vcpkg</a>. This support is available for projects using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/manifest-mode">vcpkg manifest files</a>, empowering teams to keep their library dependencies current and secure with minimal effort. With Dependabot, your repo can receive automatic pull requests to upgrade your libraries to the latest available versions.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for your projects?</h2>
<p>For C++ developers managing dependencies through vcpkg, this integration eliminates a critical gap in the DevSecOps pipeline. Dependabot will automatically scan your <code>vcpkg.json</code> manifests, monitor for updates, and create pull requests when new versions become available. This matches the automation capabilities enjoyed by other language ecosystems like JavaScript and Python.</p>
<p>Unlike most package managers, vcpkg uses a &#8220;baseline&#8221; system that&#8217;s particularly well-suited to C++&#8217;s complexity. Instead of updating individual packages piecemeal, Dependabot advances your entire baseline to a newer snapshot where all libraries have been tested together.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: rather than updating curl and leaving OpenSSL at an older version, which might cause compatibility issues, the baseline update moves you to a curated set where curl, OpenSSL, and all your other dependencies are known to work together. This approach prevents the ABI (Application Binary Interface) incompatibilities and version conflicts that plague C++ projects when libraries compiled with different settings try to interact.</p>
<p>A single change updates all unpinned dependencies to versions that vcpkg maintainers have verified work together. You can still pin specific libraries using <code>version&gt;=</code> constraints or overrides when needed. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/users/versioning.concepts">vcpkg’s versioning documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Configuration and implementation</h2>
<p>Setting up Dependabot for vcpkg follows the same pattern as other supported ecosystems. Add the following configuration to your <code>.github/dependabot.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">version: 2
updates:
- package-ecosystem: "vcpkg"
  directory: "/" # The location of your vcpkg.json
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
</code></pre>
<p>The configuration supports all standard <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference">Dependabot options</a>, including custom schedules, cooldown periods, and custom commit messages.</p>
<h2>See it in action</h2>
<p>For a practical demonstration, check out this <a href="https://github.com/JamieMagee/dependabot-vcpkg">example repository</a> that showcases Dependabot updating vcpkg dependencies. The repository includes a <code>vcpkg.json</code> manifest with a <code>builtin-baseline</code> field that Dependabot automatically updates to the latest vcpkg port repository commit. You can examine <a href="https://github.com/JamieMagee/dependabot-vcpkg/pulls">the pull requests</a> to see what Dependabot does when updates are available.</p>

<h2>Maintenance benefits</h2>
<p>The integration brings modern dependency management practices to C++ development, ensuring libraries stay current with minimal manual effort. Regular dependency updates prevent the accumulation of technical debt that occurs when libraries fall behind multiple major versions. With Dependabot handling the routine work of checking for updates, developers can focus on feature development while maintaining a healthy dependency tree.</p>
<h2>Try out the experience</h2>
<p>Automated dependency management reduces maintenance overhead and helps prevent security issues from outdated packages. By implementing Dependabot for vcpkg, you can maintain current dependencies without dedicating significant manual effort to the task.</p>
<p>Take the first step today: add the Dependabot configuration file to your repository and let automated dependency management transform how your team handles C++ package updates.</p>
