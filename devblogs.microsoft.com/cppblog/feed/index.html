										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CMake Targets View in Visual Studio is a view that allows you to visualize your CMake project structure by the CMake targets and build specified target libraries and executables. To make this view more usable, we have implemented a few new improvements to make it easier than ever to navigate your CMake targets. This includes improved navigation to the CMake Targets View, a new, more simplified CMake Targets View, and the ability to exclude specified CMake items from the Targets View. Additionally, we have future planned work in the near-term to allow users to customize this view to their desired configuration. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download the latest preview version of Visual Studio</a> to try out the new updates for the CMake Targets View.</p>
<h3 id="get-to-your-cmake-targets-view-quicker-than-ever">Get to your CMake Targets View Quicker Than Ever</h3>
<p>Customers have reported that it can be cumbersome to switch between CMake Targets View and the Solution Explorer. To address this, we have implemented new entry points to open the CMake Targets View much more quickly.</p>
<h5 id="switch-to-your-cmake-targets-view-from-solution-explorer"><em>Switch to your CMake Targets View from Solution Explorer</em></h5>
<p>Now, you can right-click anywhere in your Solution Explorer and simply navigate to the CMake Targets View from the context menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Switch-to-CMake-Targets-View.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32834 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Switch-to-CMake-Targets-View.png" alt="Right-Click Context Menu to Switch To CMake Targets View" width="1008" height="900" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Switch-to-CMake-Targets-View.png 1008w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Switch-to-CMake-Targets-View-300x268.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Switch-to-CMake-Targets-View-768x686.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a></p>
<h5 id="open-the-cmake-targets-view-from-the-view-dropdown-menu"><em>Open the CMake Targets View from the &#8216;View&#8217; Dropdown Menu</em></h5>
<p>You can also access the CMake Targets View globally at any point in your CMake projects by selecting from the View dropdown.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/cmake-targets-dropdown.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-32836 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/cmake-targets-dropdown-361x1024.png" alt="The CMake Targets View option in the View dropdown in Visual Studio" width="361" height="1024" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/cmake-targets-dropdown-361x1024.png 361w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/cmake-targets-dropdown-106x300.png 106w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/cmake-targets-dropdown.png 390w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></a></p>
<h3 id="simplify-your-source-navigation">Simplify your Source Navigation</h3>
<p>The CMake Targets View has been further simplified so that users don&#8217;t have to click through folders without buildable executables to get to their desired target.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Simplified-CMake-Targets-View-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32838" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Simplified-CMake-Targets-View-1.png" alt="Simplified CMake Targets View navigation" width="858" height="991" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Simplified-CMake-Targets-View-1.png 858w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Simplified-CMake-Targets-View-1-260x300.png 260w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Simplified-CMake-Targets-View-1-768x887.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="define-items-to-exclude-from-view">Define Items to Exclude from View</h3>
<p>You can now define in your VSWorkspaceSettings.json items to exclude from the CMake Targets View using the new <code>CMakeTargetsViewExcludedItems</code> field. The <code>CMakeTargetsViewExcludedItems</code> field is an array of strings. The field supports the following syntax and identifiers:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supported &#8220;identifiers&#8221;</span><strong>:</strong><code> CMakeProject</code>, <code>CMakeTarget</code>, <code>CMakeReference</code>,<code> CMakeFolder</code>, <code>CMakeFile</code>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Syntax for the <code>CMakeTargetsViewExcludedItems</code> is the following</span>: <code>&lt;identifier&gt;:&lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p><code></code><code></code><code></code><code></code>This will specify any identifier with the specified name.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, <code>CMakeTarget:app</code>. Any CMake targets with the name &#8220;app&#8221; anywhere in the CMake Targets View will be excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you want to specify specific items to be excluded, you can use a<code> - </code>to chain declarations together:<code>&lt;identifier&gt;:&lt;name&gt;-&lt;identifier&gt;:&lt;name&gt;...</code></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, <code>CMakeProject:thirdPartyDependency-CMakeTarget:irrelevantThirdParty</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example usage in a VSWorkspaceSettings.json:</p>
<pre><code>{</code> <code>  "CMakeTargetsViewExcludedItems": [</code> <code>    "CMakeTarget:&lt;name&gt;-CMakeFile:*", "CMakeTarget&lt;name&gt;-*-CMakeFile:*", "CMakeTarget:&lt;name&gt;-*-*-CMakeFile:*"</code> <code>}</code></pre>
<h3 id="whats-coming-next">What’s Coming Next?</h3>
<p>We are continuing to develop the CMake Targets View to allow for further customization of this view based on customer feedback. Stay tuned for the latest updates as these ship in the future!</p>
<ol>
<li>We are planning to give users the ability to filter their CMake Targets view by type of target, project, etc.</li>
<li>Users will be able to dynamically pin and unpin their most used targets to the top of the CMake Targets View.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are using this suggestion ticket to track any other requests you may have for improvements to the CMake Targets View to meet your CMake needs: <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/CMake-Targets-View-Suggestions/10471305">CMake Targets View Suggestions &#8211; Developer Community (visualstudio.com)</a></p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>To access the Remote File Explorer, navigate to <em>View &gt; Remote File Explorer</em> after downloading through the Linux and Embedded Workflow in Visual Studio. It will also now automatically open when you open a cross-platform C++ project (vcxproj for Linux or CMake project with at least one configuration in CMake Presets with a remote SSH target).</p>

<p>Our initial announcement can be viewed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/view-files-on-your-remote-machines-using-the-new-remote-file-explorer-in-visual-studio/">here</a>, which goes into browsing, uploading, and downloading files. To learn more about how to connect to a remote machine through the Connection manager, please see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/linux/connect-to-your-remote-linux-computer?view=msvc-170">these instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Now, you can view and edit these files from Visual Studio, as well as search for files through the top bar. Additionally, with the new enhanced toolbar, you are more empowered than ever to quickly perform actions on your files.</p>
<h3 id="search-your-files">Search your Files</h3>
<p>You can now search through your files and folders on your remote machine using the top bar in the Remote File Explorer. After searching, you can then right-click on any result and select “Go to remote path” to then navigate to that result’s remote path location in the Remote File Explorer.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ezgif-3-55861c14f1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32867" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ezgif-3-55861c14f1.gif" alt="a GIF of searching your files" width="916" height="829" /></a></p>
<h3 id="view-and-edit-your-files">View and Edit your Files</h3>
<p>The Remote File Explorer now allows you to view and edit files on your remote machine from Visual Studio, just like you would any other file in the Solution Explorer.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFEgif.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32828" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFEgif.gif" alt="Image RFEgif" width="1027" height="549" /></a></p>
<p>The Remote File Explorer will also automatically detect if your remote files have any changes that occurred so that you can be certain when in remote workflows.</p>
<h3 id="home-and-settings-icons">Home and Settings Icons</h3>
<p>New icons have been added to the toolbar of the Remote File Explorer to make it easier than ever to navigate and perform actions.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32824 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons.png" alt="The new Home and Settings Icons in the Remote File Explorer" width="1252" height="529" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons.png 1252w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons-300x127.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons-1024x433.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Home-and-Settings-Icons-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1252px) 100vw, 1252px" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking the home icon quickly navigates the user back to the root node. Clicking on the settings icon opens the Remote File Explorer settings that allows you to configure your Remote File Explorer.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFE-Settings.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32825 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFE-Settings.png" alt="A view of the Remote File Explorer settings" width="730" height="497" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFE-Settings.png 730w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/RFE-Settings-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></a></p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&#8217;s Next?</h3>

<p>Visual Studio now generates hints to mark member functions as <code>const</code> when a member function doesn&#8217;t modify the object&#8217;s state. This feature identifies cases where a member function performs actions that could be accomplished through the object&#8217;s public interface using a const pointer.</p>
<p>We have made this process easier for you by adding a suggestion that allows you to make a member function const. When a member function can be made const, there will be a suggestion (indicated by three dots) below the function. Hovering over them will inform you that &#8220;the member function can be made const,&#8221; and you can click on the light bulb to make the member const.</p>

<h3 id="make-function-static">Make Function Static</h3>
<p>In Visual Studio Preview, you&#8217;ll now receive hints to mark global functions as <code>static</code>. When encountering a global function that doesn&#8217;t have a forward declaration in a header file, you will be able to make the function static effortlessly. We already have a feature that detects global functions and suggests creating forward declarations, and now we have added an option to mark them as static. This feature works smoothly with modern C++ projects, as it doesn&#8217;t provide suggestions to make anonymous namespaces static. Static global functions are accessible within the translation unit where they are defined.</p>
<p>When there is a global function that doesn&#8217;t have a forward declaration, it will have a suggestion. Hovering over the suggestion will reveal a screwdriver icon, signaling that the function can be made static. You can complete the process by clicking the screwdriver icon and selecting &#8220;Make this function static.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can configure this feature&#8217;s setting in <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Text Editor</strong> <strong>&gt; C/C++</strong> &gt; <strong>IntelliSense</strong>. While the default tag is set as a suggestion, you have the flexibility to customize the severity level to none, warning, or error.</p>

<h2><span id="overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/integrating-c-header-units-into-office-using-msvc-1-n/">Last time</a> we talked about how and why header units can be integrated into a large cross-platform codebase like Office. We discussed
how header units helped surface conformance issues (good) and expose and fix compiler bugs (good-ish).</p>
<p>We talked about how we went about taking &#8220;baby steps&#8221; to integrate header units into smaller liblets—we&#8217;re talking
something on the order of 100s of header units. This blog entry is all about scale and how we move from 100s of header
units to 1000s of header units, including playing nicely with precompiled headers!</p>
<p>Office&#8217;s header unit experiments continued by following the charge that we left you with in the last blog post: &#8220;Header
Unit All the Things!&#8221;. From that perspective we were wildly successful! By the last count we were able to successfully
create over 5000 header units from liblet public headers. The road to reach that milestone wasn&#8217;t always smooth, and
we&#8217;ll cover some of the challenges.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to highlight that the recent release of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.6#17.6.6">MSVC 17.6.6</a> makes
this one of the best times to get started with header units! The release contains the full set of fixes that were
discovered in cooperation with Office. The full set of fixes will also be available in 17.7.5 and 17.8 preview 2.</p>
<h2><span id="old-code">Old Code, Old Problems</span></h2>
<p>While scaling out we encountered quite a number of complications. Some fixes involved updating Office code, while
others needed to be solved on the compiler side. We&#8217;ll present just a few examples from each bucket.</p>
<h3><span id="symlinks">Symbolic Links</span></h3>
<p>The way Office sources coalesce is a mix between sources populated by git and libraries populated by NuGet
packages which are then linked into a build source tree via symbolic links. From a build perspective, this is extremely
convenient because you can decouple library updates from the sources and you can have one copy of library code shared
across multiple copies of the git sources.</p>
<p>Symbolic links are interesting from a compiler perspective for two reasons: diagnostics and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/once?view=msvc-170"><code>#pragma once</code></a>. For source
locations, there are two options: use the symbolic link as the file name or use the physical file the link resolves to.
When issuing diagnostics, the compiler tries to use the symbolic link location because that is what was provided on the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/i-additional-include-directories?view=msvc-170"><code>/I</code></a>
line, but there are cases where you might want the physical file location.</p>
<p><code>#pragma once</code> is a whole other beast with respect to symbolic links. In the beginning, C-style include guards
were created as a method of preventing repeated file <em>content</em>. <code>#pragma once</code> came about as a method of
preventing inclusion of the <em>same file</em>. The distinction between file and content is part of the reason why <code>#pragma
once</code> is difficult to standardize due to its reliance on filesystem vagaries to identify what it means to point to the
&#8220;same file&#8221;.</p>
<p>Consider a small example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real file: <code>C:\inc\a.h</code> which contains a single <code>#pragma once</code></li>
<li>Symlink 1: <code>C:\syms\inc\lib1\a.h -&gt; C:\inc\a.h</code></li>
<li>Symlink 2: <code>C:\syms\inc\lib2\a.h -&gt; C:\inc\a.h</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Further consider a header in <code>C:\syms\inc\lib2\b.h</code>:</p>
<pre>#pragma once
#include "a.h"</pre>
<p>Then in our sources we have:</p>
<pre>#include "lib1/a.h"
#include "lib2/b.h"</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into what should happen here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler sees symlink #1 through <code>"lib1/a.h"</code>, sees <code>#pragma once</code> in the file content and records that file <code>C:\syms\inc\lib1\a.h</code> is associated with a pragma once.</li>
<li>The compiler reads <code>"lib2/b.h"</code> and sees an inclusion of <code>"lib2/a.h"</code>.</li>
<li>Symlink #2 is then read and the compiler observes that <code>#pragma once</code> is in the file content and records that file <code>C:\syms\inc\lib2\a.h</code> is associated with a pragma once.</li>
</ul>
<p>See a problem?</p>
<p>The fact that the compiler read the file content from symlink #2 is where things start to go wrong. What should
have happened is that the compiler unwraps the symbolic link to discover what the underlying file is and records the
real file as the owner of the pragma once, which is exactly what we did to solve the problem in normal compilation
scenarios.</p>
<p>How does the situation above play into header units? Header units need to work like a PCH where they record
macros and pragma state, which includes <code>#pramga once</code>. This means that the IFC needs to record symbolic
links and their &#8220;unwrapped&#8221; files so that the compiler can properly enforce <code>#pragma once</code>. After this work
was done, many more scenarios were unblocked in the Office build.</p>
<p><em>As a side note: it is always better to rely on standard C++ features to prevent repeated file content
inclusion and doing so side-steps the symbolic link problem entirely.</em></p>
<h3><span id="conditional-compilation">Inconsistent Conditional Compilation</span></h3>
<p>We called out the most critical source of issues in the first blog post: inconsistent conditional compilation. As
the experiment added projects we ran into an increasing number of conflicts. Individual projects, or sometimes
isolated build nodes, couldn&#8217;t agree if the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/j-default-char-type-is-unsigned?view=msvc-170">default char
type is unsigned</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/gr-enable-run-time-type-information?view=msvc-170">if RTTI
should be enabled</a>, or if <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040212-00/?p=40643">UNICODE support
should be set</a>, and that&#8217;s only in command line options!</p>
<p>Across liblet headers there were also code level macros to detangle: conditional selection of a memory allocator,
masks for disallowed Windows SDK functions, plus the <code>ASSUME</code> macro example still hadn&#8217;t been resolved! Solving such
problems could require touching nearly every project in Office.</p>
<h3><span id="internal-linkage">Internal Linkage</span></h3>
<p>Declarations at namespace, including global, scope marked <code>static</code> have internal linkage. With textual includes
this isn&#8217;t an issue for declarations such as <code>static const float pi = 3.14</code> because the contents of the header file become
part of the translation unit. The source used to compile a header unit is a translation unit unto itself and thus the
definition of <code>pi</code> will not be visible when it is imported. Fortunately, the fix is simple. Such data declarations
should be marked as <code>inline constexpr</code>. However, after converting the constant declarations to be <code>inline constexpr</code> we
were still seeing many unresolved symbols during linking. These issues ultimately required a compiler change so that
IFC could contain the full initialization information for the data.</p>
<p>Naturally, the compiler had to account for the common case where global variables marked as <code>inline constexpr</code>
should have their values encoded into the actual IFC. In general, the compiler already does this for simpler values
such as integral types, but more complex user-defined types or arrays of objects had to be accounted for. As a compiler optimization, the variable is only instantiated when it is referenced.
More specifically, the compiler will only materialize the initializer if the variable is odr-used.</p>
<h3><span id="internal-linkage">Mismatched Include Paths</span></h3>
<p>Office has continued to utilize the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/translateinclude?view=msvc-170"><code>/translateInclude</code></a>
flag to consume header units without rewriting source code. For this to operate as expected the <code>#include</code>
directives in source must match what is specified by a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/headerunit?view=msvc-170"><code>/headerUnit</code></a>
switch. In Office the most common issue was a reference that used the internal path to a header instead of the external
one.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 84px;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 28px;">
<td style="width: 7.59961%; height: 28px;">Example switch:</td>
<td style="width: 92.4004%; height: 28px;"><code>/headerUnit:quote componentA/publicheader.h=ifcdir/publicheader.h.ifc</code></td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 28px;">
<td style="width: 7.59961%; height: 28px;">Incorrect path:</td>
<td style="width: 92.4004%; height: 28px;"><code>#include &lt;src/public/publicheader.h&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 28px;">
<td style="width: 7.59961%; height: 28px;">Correct path:</td>
<td style="width: 92.4004%; height: 28px;"><code>#include &lt;componentA/publicheader.h&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above example the incorrect path will not match the <em>header-filename</em> portion of the
<code>/headerUnit</code> switch and thus will be textually included. Finding incorrect include paths is tricky because
the code will compile correctly. The best way to discover any issues is to examine the output provided by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/sourcedependencies?view=msvc-170"><code>/sourceDependencies</code></a>
for unexpected textual includes.</p>
<h3><span id="ifc-updates">Updating the IFC Specification</span></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s been a perennial feedback bug since the original modules implementation in the compiler: <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/using-namespace-declaration-ignored-wh/10211461">`using namespace`
declaration ignored when compiling as a header unit module</a>. The problem was that the IFC had no representation for
using-directives at namespace scope (e.g. <code>using namespace std;</code>). It turns out that Office also ran into this issue so to continue the experiment,
we had to fix it. After some thinking through the problem, we came up with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ifc-spec/pull/76">IFC-76</a> which describes an encoding method
for persisting directives in a translation unit.</p>
<h3><span id="assumptions">Breaking Historical Assumptions</span></h3>
<p>Before modules existed, the compiler had been around for nearly 25 years. This was enough time for the toolchain
to develop several assumptions about how the front-end conveys data to the back-end. One such coupling was
encoding type information directly into compiled functions. Handles to the compiler-generated type information are 0-index-based and the underlying data is generated along with each handle. There was one case where this type index was
emitted directly into a tree for the purposes of annotating type information with <code>new</code> expressions for the
debugger:</p>
<pre>int* make_int() {
  return new int{}; // &lt;- generated a direct encoding of the type index for 'new'
}</pre>
<p>Why does this encoding cause a problem for modules? Since the compiler is now persisting compiled inline
functions into the IFC the compiler also persists this type index from one compilation to the next and would, sometimes,
cause a linker crash as it goes to lookup the type index from the PDB but crashes because the index for that particular
translation unit is based on an array generated in a completely different translation unit. Office was able to reveal
this issue very quickly as many of the link steps involved lots of translation units from which this bug would
surface.</p>
<h3><span id="windows-sdk">Windows SDK Woes</span></h3>
<p>There is a, quite an old now, bug out: <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-cant-find-time-function/1126857">Visual Studio can&#8217;t find time() function using modules and std.core</a>. The
root cause here is that the UCRT contains a definition of the <code>time()</code> function from C where it is defined as a <code>static
inline</code> function within the SDK header. These <code>static inline</code> functions stem from C not having the C++ meaning of
<code>inline</code> but <code>static inline</code> on a function declaration allows the function to behave as if it had C++ <code>inline</code>-like
semantics. Note that defining the C standard function <code>time()</code> as <code>static inline</code> is in direct violation of the C
standard which explicitly says that C standard library functions have external linkage. The Windows SDK team is hard at
work fixing the issue above along with some other SDK issues that have plagued C++ modules interactions in the past, so
stay tuned for fixes soon!</p>
<h2><span id="rethink">Rethinking Compiler Tooling</span></h2>
<p>As we scaled the number of projects being built by the compiler using the header unit technology it became
immediately evident that we quickly needed to rethink how to debug compiler problems. The traditional loop involved
either reducing the failure to a simple two or three file repro or attaching to a remote debugging instance where the
compiler was running on the build machine. It&#8217;s easy to see how and why these approaches do not scale. Here are the
concrete problems we needed to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduction data collection should be asynchronous. We did not want the process of capturing a repro to be a blocking task.</li>
<li>The data emitted by the compiler should be rich enough to reproduce the failure without debugging a remote compiler.</li>
<li>The process of emitting data should be completely opt-in and not have a performance impact if you did not request it.</li>
<li>The tool should offer a powerful visualization of the data such that we can easily navigate it and identify the underlying problem quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the requirements outlined we designed a system inside the compiler which would act as a trace logging system
for any modules-related functionality. If you would find value in using these types of tools, please let us
know!</p>
<h2><span id="ifc-ref">A New Approach to Referencing an IFC</span></h2>
<p>Before the Office header unit experiments, the compiler relied on a pair of command line switches to specify
individual IFC files: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/module-reference?view=msvc-170"><code>/reference</code></a>
for named modules, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/headerunit?view=msvc-170"><code>/headerUnit</code></a> for
header units. It turns out that when thousands of header units or named modules are involved the command line grows
quite long and unwieldy! An enormous list of flags is difficult to work with if there are compiler bugs to investigate,
as you cannot &#8216;comment&#8217; out a header unit reference easily. We solved this problem by implementing a new
way of conveying IFC dependencies to the compiler: <code>/ifcMap</code>. The <code>/ifcMap</code> allows the user to provide an IFC reference map
file, which is a subset of the <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a> file format, to the compiler which details a mapping from named module name or
header-name to its respective IFC which should be loaded. Here&#8217;s a quick example of a valid .toml file for the switch:</p>
<pre># Header Units
[[header-unit]]
name = ['quote', 'm1.h']
ifc = 'm1.h.ifc'

[[header-unit]]
name = ['quote', 'm2.h']
ifc = 'm2.h.ifc'

# Modules
[[module]]
name = 'm1'

<p><code>/ifcMap</code> allowed office to scale the number of header units painlessly and offer a solution to easily manage lots
of header unit references beyond having them splat on one giant command line. The IFC map also enables a tight
iterative approach when considering factors like debugging needs, both for the developer and the compiler team.</p>
<h2><span id="pch">Playing Nice with Precompiled Headers (PCH)</span></h2>
<p>Part of scaling out for the compiler is that large projects often use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/creating-precompiled-header-files?view=msvc-170">PCH</a> as a way of
achieving build speed. PCH is a reliable technology and has had the benefit of over 30 years of hardening and
optimization. Header units as the standardized replacement for PCH still need to integrate seamlessly into these older
build environments still using tried and true PCH technology. Furthermore, Office needs to maintain compatibility with
the non-Windows platforms that aren&#8217;t ready to adopt header units yet.</p>
<p>The approach mentioned last time to force include the Office shared precompiled header file into each header unit
resulted in a lot of duplicated parsing in the compiler. To that end we added support to consume the binary PCH
directly when creating a header unit. This resulted in a nice performance win when compiling header units!
Unfortunately, this resulted in a large build throughput degradation when consuming header units. As much as possible
we would need to get precompiled headers out of the picture.</p>
<p>The first, naïve, tactic was to ensure that each public header was truly self-contained. Eliminating invisible
dependencies felt like a virtuous task, even without considering the benefits to the header unit experiment! Thousands
of <code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</code> and <code>#include &lt;stl.h&gt;</code> additions later, we were ready to
test performance again… and it was barely any better. The issue is that precompiled headers and IFC are fundamentally
different technologies. Requiring the compiler to reconcile data from both sources is incredibly wasteful. The headers
being compiled into header units were free of binary PCH dependencies but a majority of cpp files were still using both
technologies.</p>
<p>At this point it&#8217;s worth noting that we measured a significant build throughput improvement in projects that
consumed header units but did not utilize a precompiled header. Individual compilands that switched from traditional
PCH consumption to PCH-as-header unit import, saw build time improvements well above 50%. This is one of the key
benefits that modules promised!</p>
<p>The idea to <em>create a header unit out of the existing PCH</em> was the flash of insight we needed to keep the experiment
moving forward! Although the compiler allows mixing PCH and header units it&#8217;s much more efficient to &#8220;pick a lane&#8221; in
your build system. By not presenting duplicate information to the compiler, it&#8217;s easier to create build throughput
wins.</p>
<h2><span id="selection">Selecting a Launch Project: Microsoft Word</span></h2>
<p>Although we were able to scale the experiment up and generate over 5000 header units from our liblet public
headers, some low-level blocks needed to be cleared before we could utilize header units in our production build
environment. We looked for a sizable project that could avoid the inconsistent conditional compilation issues that
needed more time to clean up. Luckily, we found a great candidate in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Word has utilized MSVC&#8217;s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build-insights/get-started-with-cpp-build-insights?view=msvc-170">C++ Build
Insights</a> to craft optimal precompiled headers. Specifically, the techniques presented in <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/faster-builds-with-pch-suggestions-from-c-build-insights/">Faster builds with PCH
suggestions from C++ Build Insights &#8211; C++ Team Blog</a> were used to measure the performance benefit for
each individual file included in their main PCH. Word was to be our first test converting existing precompiled headers
directly to header units. At a high level the steps required were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a header unit instead of a pch.  Switch<code>/Yc</code> to <code>/exportHeader</code></li>
<li>Replace the use PCH flag with a standard header unit reference: <code>/Yu</code> to <code>/headerUnit:quote word_shared.h=path/to/word_shared.ifc</code></li>
<li>Profit?</li>
</ol>
<p>The code changes required in Word after adjusting the build flags were similar to what was described above. Constants needed to be made <code>inline
constexpr</code>, missing includes or forward declarations added, and a handful of function definitions moved out-of-line. In
total only 2 dozen C++ files in Word required code changes to compile successfully after the switch! The most unexpected of
these changes were to standardize on quotes instead of angle brackets when writing the PCH&#8217;s <code>#include</code> for the sake of consistency with
the <code>/headerUnit</code> switch.</p>
<p>Along with the conversion from Word&#8217;s PCH to header units we created a header unit from the standard library.
In the C++23 world, C++ projects can utilize the standard library module that ships alongside the compiler via <code>import std;</code> or <code>import
std.compat;</code>. Unfortunately, Office makes edits to the standard library and thus must create its own header unit or
named module.</p>
<p>With this set of changes, we proved it possible to compile, link and launch Microsoft Word with header units!</p>

<h2><span id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead: Throughput</span></h2>
<p>The next step was to demonstrate the advantages that header units would bring to the Word engineering team.
Fortunately, we were able to show a build performance improvement great enough that the team agreed to adopt header
units into the Office production build system alongside msvc 17.6.6! In our next installment we&#8217;ll go over our performance findings in
depth.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7 Preview 3, we have refactored the MSVC Address Sanitizer (ASan) to depend on one runtime DLL regardless of the runtime configuration. This simplifies project onboarding and supports more scenarios, particularly for projects statically linked (<code>/MT</code>, <code>/MTd</code>) to the C Runtimes. However, static configurations have a new dependency on the ASan runtime DLL.</p>
<p>Summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASan now works with <code>/MT</code> or <code>/MTd</code> built DLLs when the host EXE was not compiled with ASan. This includes Windows services, COM components, and plugins.</li>
<li>Configuring your project with ASan is now simpler, since your project doesn’t need to uniformly specify the same <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library?view=msvc-170">runtime configuration</a> (<code>/MT</code>, <code>/MTd</code>, <code>/MD</code>, <code>/MDd</code>).</li>
<li>ASan workflows and pipelines for <code>/MT</code> or <code>/MTd</code> built projects will need to ensure the ASan DLL (clang_rt.asan_dynamic-&lt;arch&gt;.dll) is available on PATH.</li>
<li>The names of the ASan .lib files needed by the linker have changed (the linker normally takes care of this if not manually specifying lib names via <code>/INFERASANLIBS</code>)</li>
<li>You cannot mix ASan-compiled binaries from previous versions of the MSVC Address Sanitizer (this is always true, but especially true in this case).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation-and-effects">Motivation and Effects</h2>
<p>When building a project, you must specify how you want to link to the C and C++ Runtime Libraries. Using the <code>/MD</code> option will link dynamically to the runtimes and have DLL dependencies provided by the Windows operating system (ex: ucrtbase.dll) and the VC++ Redistributable (ex: vcruntime140.dll, msvcp140.dll). This is a great default option to choose, as it allows you to take advantage of the latest available on the system and minimizes memory usage. The /MT option specifies that the runtime libraries will be statically linked (via libucrt.lib, libvcruntime.lib, libcpmt.lib, etc) in your program such that you have no VC++ DLL dependencies. This option is useful when dynamically linking complicates deployment and is most frequently used with projects like plugins or drivers.</p>
<p>Prior to Visual Studio 2022 v17.7 Preview 3, MSVC Address Sanitizer followed the same methodology and treated itself as one of the runtime libraries. If <code>/MD</code> was specified, ASan would be available as a DLL (clang_rt.asan_dynamic-&lt;arch&gt;.dll). If <code>/MT</code> was specified, ASan would be linked into the EXE. ASan can only have one instance at a time, so DLLs that were statically linked would assume the EXE of the process was also built with ASan and would call into that EXE for support. This caused problems for any software that could not recompile the host EXE with ASan enabled: plugins, COM components, Windows services, etc. Here is <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/C-Address-Sanitizer:-statically-linked/1403680">an example reported on Developer Community</a>. Additionally, since each runtime configuration had its own version of ASan, you could not mix components with different runtime configurations.</p>
<p>As of Visual Studio v17.7 Preview 3, runtime configuration is no longer considered and there is one Address Sanitizer DLL per architecture. In addition to supporting more scenarios, this can also significantly simplify onboarding a complex project with ASan. A side effect is that projects statically linked with <code>/MT</code> or <code>/MTd</code> now have a dependency on the ASan runtime DLL.</p>
<h2 id="link-time-changes-inferasanlibs">Link Time Changes (/INFERASANLIBS)</h2>
<p>When <code>/fsanitize=address</code> is passed to the compiler, <code>/INFERASANLIBS</code> will automatically be passed to the linker, which will take care of the link time requirements for Address Sanitizer.</p>
<p>If you use <code>/INFERASANLIBS:NO</code> in your build and manually specify which ASan libraries you link with, you will also need to change which .lib files are passed to the linker.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The MSVC AddressSanitizer does not attempt to maintain compatibility with older versions, unlike other MSVC libraries. You should deploy a version of the AddressSanitizer DLL that matches the version of the toolset used when compiling your ASan-instrumented code. Here are some common issues you may see if you are mixing ASan-enabled projects built before and after Visual Studio 2022 17.7 Preview 3:</p>
<p><strong>“The code execution cannot proceed because clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll was not found.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The code execution cannot proceed because clang_rt.asan_dynamic-i386.dll was not found.”</strong></p>
<p>These messages are displayed when an ASan binary was deployed in an environment without the AddressSanitizer DLL. If you are seeing this immediately after updating to Visual Studio 2022 17.7 Preview 3 and you are statically linking to the C Runtime (<code>/MT</code>, <code>/MTd</code>), that binary has a new dependency on the ASan DLL named and must be included in the environment. Please update the PATH to include clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll (x64) or clang_rt.asan_dynamic-i386.dll (x86).</p>
<p><strong>“The procedure entry point __sanitizer_override_function could not be located in the dynamic link library.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The procedure entry point __sanitizer_register_weak_function could not be located in the dynamic link library.”</strong></p>
<p>These messages are displayed when a binary built with 17.7 Preview 3 is deployed in an environment with an AddressSanitizer DLL from a toolset prior to 17.7 Preview 3. Please update clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll (x64) or clang_rt.asan_dynamic-i386.dll (x86) to the latest version included with your current version of Visual Studio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new CMake Debugger that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cmake-debugger-allows-you-to-debug-your-cmake-scripts-and-more/">was introduced in Visual Studio</a> is now available in VS Code. Now, you can debug your CMakeLists.txt scripts from VS Code using <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">the CMake Tools Extension</a>. To see the full release notes for this release and what else is included, including bug fixes, please see the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">release notes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The Visual C++ team collaborated closely with Kitware, the CMake maintainers, to <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/8838">merge our CMake debugger implementation upstream</a> and make this widely available. This implementation is now available in <a href="https://www.kitware.com/software-releases/">CMake version 3.27</a>. Please download the latest version for your OS via <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">this link</a> or update via your system package manager to access the CMake debugger in VS Code. You can check your CMake version on your machine at any time by running <code>cmake –version</code> in a terminal window. CMake 3.27 will ship with Visual Studio in a later release in 17.8.</p>
<p>The debugger uses the widely supported <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/tools">Debug Adapter Protocol,</a> which is compatible with many development environments.  We are excited to see how the open-source community works together to implement new ideas for the debugger.</p>
<h3 id="cmake-debugger-functionality">CMake Debugger Functionality</h3>
<p>As a user, you’ll see the same functionality as you would in a normal debugging session. This includes viewing variables, call stacks, and cache variables specific to CMake and the ability to set breakpoints on your CMakeLists.txt file and step through your code.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-files">Comparing Files</h2>
<p>You no longer need to leave Visual Studio and rely on other tools to compare files. Now you can easily compare any file in Solution Explorer with other files by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-clicking on a single file, selecting “Compare With…” from the context menu which will bring up File Explorer. Navigating to any file on disk and selecting it for comparison.</li>
<li>Multi-selecting two files by holding down <strong>Ctrl</strong> then right-clicking and selecting “Compare Selected” from the context menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please share your feedback <a href="https://www.research.net/r/comparefilesga">here</a>.  We’d love to hear your thoughts on this new experience.</p>
<h2 id="copy-and-trim-indentation">Copy and Trim Indentation</h2>
<p>If you have ever copied code from Visual Studio to another application (Outlook, Teams, Slack, etc.) and found that your code indentation has not been copied correctly, you will find that this new capability fixes that for you. Visual Studio now automatically fixes indentation for you when you copy code from Visual Studio and paste it in another application.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="815" height="450" class="wp-image-32688" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen-description-aut.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen-description-aut.png 815w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen-description-aut-300x166.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen-description-aut-768x424.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /></p>
<h2 id="parallel-stack-filtering">Parallel Stack Filtering</h2>
<p>You can use the updated Parallel Stack filtering options that let you selectively display or hide specific threads or frames. This means you can easily concentrate on the threads and frames that are important to you, giving you a clearer picture. Additionally, you can now Drag Select frames from the parallel stack window, allowing you to perform operations like copy/paste, flag/unflag, or freeze/thaw for all the selected frames at once.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1770" height="911" class="wp-image-32689" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica.gif" alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" /></p>
<h2 id="f5-speed">F5 Speed</h2>
<p>We have optimized Program Database (PDB) files, resulting in improving debugging sessions and decreasing the project selection screen loading time for Unreal projects for example by 21% (~4 sec gain). Additionally, the F5 path is optimized, leading to a 5-10% improvement in the debugger&#8217;s startup time and process launch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="846" height="309" class="wp-image-32690" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-enhanced-f5-speed.png" alt="Image Enhanced F5 Speed" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-enhanced-f5-speed.png 846w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-enhanced-f5-speed-300x110.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-enhanced-f5-speed-768x281.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" /></p>
<h2 id="all-in-one-search-responsiveness">All-in-One Search Responsiveness</h2>
<p>Several accuracy and performance enhancements are coming to All-in-One Search. For example, exact matches now show higher in the results list and results update more accurately in real time as you type your query.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="852" height="504" class="wp-image-32691" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-1.gif" alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" /></p>

<h2 id="c-unreal-engine-time-to-intellisense">C++ Unreal Engine Time to IntelliSense</h2>
<p>In Unreal Engine projects, the time for IntelliSense and colorization to become ready in newly opened C++ files is significantly reduced. The generation of IntelliSense cache (IPCH) is now 30% faster in Unreal Engine 5.1 and 5.2 projects and 15% faster in Unreal Engine 4.27 projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="868" height="209" class="wp-image-32693" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica.png 868w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-300x72.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-768x185.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<h2 id="unreal-engine-macros-formatting-for-c">Unreal Engine Macros Formatting for C++</h2>
<p>We have added an option to use special indentation rules for Unreal Engine macros. Visual Studio will detect and use indentation and formatting rules for your Unreal Engine reflection macros.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="660" height="371" class="wp-image-32694" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-macros-formatting-for-c.png" alt="Image Unreal Engine Macros Formatting for C" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-macros-formatting-for-c.png 660w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-macros-formatting-for-c-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>To turn on Unreal Engine specific formatting, search “Unreal Engine” in Options or go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Text Editor &gt; C/C++ &gt; Code Style &gt; Formatting &gt; Unreal Engine and check “Apply special formatting for Slate declarative syntax and Unreal Engine reflection macros.”</p>
<h2 id="unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker-for-c">Unreal Engine Naming Convention Checker for C++</h2>
<p>Visual Studio will now give you hints when your symbols are not conformant to the Unreal Engine coding style. After adding <a href="https://aka.ms/uenamingconvention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an .editorconfig file </a> to your Unreal Engine project, Visual Studio will display naming convention warnings in the Error List and provide a Quick Fix option upon right-clicking.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="869" height="490" class="wp-image-32696" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker-for.png" alt="Image Unreal Engine Naming Convention Checker for C" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker-for.png 869w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker-for-300x169.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker-for-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
<p>To change whether Visual Studio should treat the checks as Warnings or Suggestions, go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Text Editor &gt; C/C++ &gt; Code Style &gt; Linter and change “Naming Convention (experimental)”.</p>
<h2 id="unreal-engine-blueprint-find-all-references">Unreal Engine Blueprint Find All References</h2>
<p>In this release, you will be able to search for references of <code>UFUNCTION</code>s in Blueprints with the new Blueprint Find All References. The latest version of our Unreal Engine plugin <a href="http://aka.ms/vsuemarketplace">“Visual Studio Integration Tool”</a> is required.</p>
<p><em><img decoding="async" width="1202" height="367" class="wp-image-32699" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-2.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-2.png 1202w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-2-300x92.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-2-1024x313.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-2-768x234.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px" /></em></p>
<h2 id="improved-doxygen-overload-resolution">Improved Doxygen overload resolution</h2>
<p>Support for Doxygen comments has been enhanced, allowing the display of shared Doxygen comments in overloads that are not directly positioned beneath the comments. Furthermore, to enhance clarity and organization, any parameters that are unused will be conveniently grouped under the heading “Unused Parameter.” See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-doxygen-overload-resolution/">Improved Doxygen Overload Resolution</a> to learn more about this feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="864" height="419" class="wp-image-32697" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-improved-doxygen-overload-resolution.png" alt="Image Improved Doxygen overload resolution" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-improved-doxygen-overload-resolution.png 864w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-improved-doxygen-overload-resolution-300x145.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-improved-doxygen-overload-resolution-768x372.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></p>
<h2 id="visualize-macro-expansion-for-c">Visualize Macro Expansion for C++</h2>
<p>Visual Studio now enables you to observe the step-by-step expansion of macros. When hovering over a macro, a tooltip with a new &#8220;Visualize Macro&#8221; option shows up. Clicking on &#8220;Visualize Macro&#8221; opens a new window displaying the initial expansion of the macro. With the help of arrows, you can navigate through each expansion step. Clicking the window tool button will display the steps of the expansion in a different window. See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visualize-macro-expansion-for-c/">Visualize Macro Expansion for C++</a> to learn more about this feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="911" height="468" class="wp-image-32698" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-program-description-au-1.gif" alt="A screenshot of a computer program Description automatically generated" /></p>
<h1 id="linux-and-embedded-development">Linux and Embedded Development</h1>
<h2 id="wsl-automatic-acquisition">WSL Automatic Acquisition</h2>
<p>With the Linux and Embedded Workload, Visual Studio now makes it easier than ever to get to that one-click download of WSL. When you open a CMake project that can target Linux, a gold bar will open for users to click and open a WSL installation process. By default, it will install an Ubuntu machine. Additionally, you can open the dialog by navigation to <strong>Project &gt; Install WSL For Me</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1100" height="410" class="wp-image-32700" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-wsl-automatic-acquisition.png" alt="Image WSL Automatic Acquisition" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-wsl-automatic-acquisition.png 1100w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-wsl-automatic-acquisition-300x112.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-wsl-automatic-acquisition-1024x382.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/image-wsl-automatic-acquisition-768x286.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></p>
<h2 id="remote-file-explorer-updates">Remote File Explorer Updates</h2>
<p>We have added search capability to the Remote File Explorer. You are now able to search for files based on where you are in your remote machine along the top bar, and then right-click to go to any found file’s location. To open the Remote File Explorer, navigate to <strong>View &gt; Remote File Explorer</strong> after downloading it with the Linux and Embedded Workflow in Visual Studio.</p>
<h1 id="enterprise-management-and-acquisition">Enterprise Management and Acquisition</h1>
<h2 id="ability-for-standard-users-to-update-and-modify-visual-studio">Ability for standard users to update and modify Visual Studio</h2>
<p>Many enterprises spend a great deal of time and effort keeping their organization secure. They follow best practices by configuring users and machines to have a minimum level of access permissions, and they invest a lot of energy in keeping their organization’s software updated.</p>
<p>When organizations do restrict user permissions, it compromises their ability to keep Visual Studio updated and secure. The Visual Studio installer requires administrator permissions to use, but when users don’t have this level of access, they are prevented from updating Visual Studio and acquiring the latest security fixes and features. This problem was one of our <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Allow-Visual-Studio-to-install-without-a/640424">top developer community reported issues</a>.</p>
<p>We’re happy to announce that starting with the 17.7 installer, standard users with minimized permissions can now update and modify Visual Studio! The initial bootstrapping and policy configuration to enable this must still be done by an administrator, but after that, any installer functionality can be initiated and executed by a non-administrator user.</p>
<p>This feature will offer organizations more flexibility and make it easier for you to configure and maintain a secure and productive environment.</p>
<h2 id="rollback-now-preserves-all-user-settings">Rollback now preserves all user settings</h2>
<p>We continue to make improvements to our recently shipped feature that gives you the option to &#8220;rollback an update&#8221;. If you now roll back to a version 17.7 or higher, all your local customizations such as user settings will be preserved. For more information, please visit the <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/rollback">Rollback blogpost.</a></p>

<p>Some stats for this period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>59 new ports</strong> were added to the open-source registry. If you are unfamiliar with the term ‘port’, they are packages that are built from source and are typically C/C++ libraries.</li>
<li><strong>976 updates</strong> were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our nine main triplets.</li>
<li>There are now <strong>2,249 total libraries</strong> available in the vcpkg public registry.</li>
<li><strong>87 contributors</strong> submitted PRs, issues, or participated in discussions in the repo.</li>
<li>The main vcpkg repo has over <strong>5,500 forks</strong> and <strong>19,300 stars</strong> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="notable-changes">Notable Changes</h3>
<p>Notable changes for this release are summarized below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="github-dependency-graph-api">GitHub Dependency Graph API</h4>
<p>In June, we announced <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-integration-with-the-github-dependency-graph/">vcpkg integration with the GitHub dependency graph</a>. This is available for all vcpkg users on the 2023.07.21 release. If you are a GitHub user, we highly recommend checking it out to visualize your repo’s dependencies. We will continue building on this integration in the future and are looking for feedback!</p>
<p>PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/989">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool/#989</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="android-tested-triplets">Android Tested Triplets</h4>
<p>We have promoted several Android community triplets to tested triplets. This means they are now tested and validated on all port changes (as of the 2023.06.20 release) and will be listed in the tested triplets table in each release.</p>
<p>The new Android tested triplets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm-neon-android</li>
<li>x64-android</li>

<h4 id="xbox-triplet-improvements">Xbox Triplet Improvements</h4>
<p>In a previous release, community triplets were released for vcpkg users wishing to target Xbox. In this release, several improvements were made to this experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a post build check that libraries don’t link with kernel32, as Xbox does not have kernel32.</li>
<li><code>GameDKLatest</code>is now included in binary cache keys. Xbox triplets require the user of the GameDK, GRDK, and GXDK headers which are supplied through external environment variables. With this change, binary caching will track the version of these dependencies for the purpose of determining when a binary can be restored without re-building.</li>
<li>Improvements to triplet selection and turning on the <em>xbox</em> identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="updates-to-depend-info-command">Updates to depend-info Command</h4>
<p><code>vcpkg depend-info</code>displays all transitive dependencies for a package in several formats, including plain text, DGML, DOT, etc. This feature can be useful to gain a better understanding of a package’s dependency graph. A user contribution recently added the Mermaid format as an additional option. Furthermore, we made some changes to the way depend-info is used by moving the display options under a common <code>--format</code> subcommand. We believe this layout will make it easier to scale this feature in the future if we add further formatting styles. For more details on how to use depend-info after these changes, see our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/commands/depend-info">vcpkg depend-info documentation</a>.</p>
<p>PRs: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1080">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool/#1080</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/935">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool/#935</a> (thanks @WimLefrere!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="allow-vcpkg-remove-export-and-x-package-info-without-overlay-triplets">Allow vcpkg remove, export, and x-package-info without overlay triplets</h4>
<p>In cases where a vcpkg user creates and manages <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/triplets#adding-or-replacing-triplets">overlay triplets</a>, the commands vcpkg remove, export, and x-package-info can now be run without having to specify those overlay triplets every time. This was extra information that the commands don’t need in order to run successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Previous behavior (example): </strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">vcpkg install --overlay-triplets a-directory-containing-triplets zlib:my-custom-triplet</code></pre>
<p>Runs without issues.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">vcpkg remove zlib:my-custom-triplet</code></pre>
<p>Throws an error, vcpkg doesn’t know what my-custom-triplet is.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Picture1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32655" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Picture1.png" alt="vcpkg.exe remove zlib:my-custom-triplet example" width="720" height="270" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Picture1.png 720w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Picture1-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>Instead, you previously had to say:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">vcpkg remove --overlay-triplets a-directory-containing-triplets zlib:my-custom-triplet</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New behavior (example): </strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">vcpkg install --overlay-triplets a-directory-containing-triplets zlib:my-custom-triplet

vcpkg remove zlib:my-custom-triplet</code></pre>
<p>Both commands should run successfully.

<h4 id="overrides-can-select-ports-that-are-no-longer-in-the-baseline">Overrides Can Select Ports That Are No Longer in the Baseline</h4>
<p>It is now possible to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/versioning#overrides">override</a> ports that aren’t available in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/versioning#baselines">baseline</a> in a vcpkg.json file. While very rare with ports in the vcpkg open-source registry, it is possible for a port to be removed from a more recent baseline if it stops being compatible with the rest of the catalog and is no longer being maintained to stop breaking other ports. Previously, it was impossible to reference one of these archived ports in a more recent vcpkg installation using port versioning features. Now, you can use overrides to bring in the port and version that you want even if it isn’t in the current baseline.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to bring you the 3rd batch of exciting Unreal Engine integrations in Visual Studio 2022! Since our initial announcements, our team has been hard at work building additional integrations based on your invaluable feedback. Recently, we have been working closely with our partners at <strong>The Coalition</strong>. Their work on the popular <strong>Gears of War</strong> franchise inspired us to ship a new feature that allows you to search for Blueprint UFUNCTION references. Today, we are excited to unveil additional performance improvements and a host of new features that will take your game development productivity to new heights.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore how you can check whether your code follows UE Naming Convention, apply special indentation rules for UE Macros, and see how Find All Blueprint References works! In addition, we will share a list of valuable productivity features that will benefit all C++ developers. All these powerful features and performance improvements are available in the latest Visual Studio 2022 17.7 Preview 2.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s awesome to be able to partner and collaborate with the Visual Studio team on features such as ‘Find All Blueprint References’ as it brings great value not only to our development team but anyone using the Unreal Engine. Additions like this show that the Visual Studio team not only listen to the gaming community but are also actively working to make iteration in engines like Unreal better than ever.”</p>
<p>&#8211; Phil Cousins, Tech Director, The Coalition</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="unreal-engine-blueprint-find-all-references">Unreal Engine Blueprint Find All References</h2>
<p>Get ready to level up your Blueprints workflow! Available now, you can easily search for UFUNCTION references from within Visual Studio. Start by right clicking on the symbol and click “Find All Blueprint References”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32625" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1.png" alt="Image uebpfar entry" width="1980" height="663" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1.png 1980w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1-300x100.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1-1024x343.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1-768x257.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/uebpfar-entry-1-1536x514.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px" /></a></p>

<h2 id="code-analysis-for-unreal-engine-naming-convention-checker">Code Analysis for Unreal Engine: Naming Convention Checker</h2>
<p>Visual Studio will now help you keep your code conformant to the Unreal Engine Naming Convention. By adding a <a href="https://aka.ms/uenamingconvention">.editorconfig file</a> to your project at the solution root level, you will receive real-time hints in the Error List window when your symbols do not match the UE naming convention. In addition, Quick Fixes are available at your fingertips for an easy resolution.</p>

<h2 id="performance-boosts-for-c-game-development">Performance Boosts for C++ Game Development</h2>
<p>Since our <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/faster-cpp-source-code-indexing/">blog</a> last year, the team has continued to work on additional performance improvements for large C++ projects. We have significantly sped-up Solution Load and Solution Close scenarios. In addition, the time it takes to parse C++ solutions for the first time is also greatly reduced. Lastly, we made further improvements for the time it takes to get to your code. While these improvements are significant for large projects, you should still notice a speedup if your project is smaller in nature. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-17-6-performance-enhancements/">Visual Studio blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="testing-methodology">Testing Methodology</h3>
<p>We used a real-world AAA Unreal Engine 5 game to benchmark the performance improvements in Visual Studio 2022. We measured the scenarios by capturing internal logs. The graphs below illustrate the improvements over the course of one year, from version 17.2 in May 2022 to version 17.6 in May 2023. To replicate real-world game developer workflow, we used a gaming PC with high RAM and core count.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="impact-analysis">Impact Analysis</h3>
<p>Our biggest performance improvement is a 3.2x speed-up in Visual Studio&#8217;s parsing of C++ projects during the first run. We received valuable feedback from game developers on how to enhance this area, and we&#8217;re eager to hear how much more productive you&#8217;ll be when opening projects for the first time.</p>
<p>Next, thanks to community and game developer feedback, we allocated additional resources to focus on the Solution Load and Close scenarios. We heard that these are important workflow scenarios, especially from those who may open and close solutions multiple times a day. While the numerical reduction is a few seconds, we hope that this improvement will further improve productivity and reduce mental task switching throughout the day.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have made additional performance improvements to colorization and search on top of previous improvements. Please stay tuned as we continue to make investments in the performance of Visual Studio in these areas.</p>

When you hover over a macro, you can access Quick Info, which now includes the Visualize Expansion link in addition to the Copy and Expand Inline options. The Visual Expansion will enable you to visualize the preprocessor passes of the expansion.</p>

<p>The Visual Expansion link opens a new window that initially displays the first step of macro expansion. By utilizing the arrows next to the expansion step numbers, you can easily navigate through the subsequent steps of the expansion. This feature proves especially valuable in scenarios involving nested macros with lengthy expansions. In cases where nested macros have long expansions, this feature will help to precisely identify the actions taking place at each step, facilitating a deeper understanding of the macro&#8217;s behavior. </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">Ultimately, this</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> feature </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">greatly enhances</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> the efficiency of your debugging efforts, enabling you to pinpoint and resolve issues more effectively. </span></span><span class="TextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" lang="EN-029" xml:lang="EN-029" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-charstyle="eop" data-ccp-charstyle-defn="{&quot;ObjectId&quot;:&quot;2d7dabfc-e829-4638-80ba-daf00f88ebc6|36&quot;,&quot;ClassId&quot;:1073872969,&quot;Properties&quot;:[469775450,&quot;eop&quot;,201340122,&quot;1&quot;,134233614,&quot;true&quot;,469778129,&quot;eop&quot;,335572020,&quot;1&quot;,469778324,&quot;Default Paragraph Font&quot;]}"> </span></span><span class="EOP SCXW234140103 BCX8" data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
