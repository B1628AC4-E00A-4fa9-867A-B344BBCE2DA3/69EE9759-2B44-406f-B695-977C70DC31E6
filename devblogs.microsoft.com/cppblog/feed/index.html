										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post summarizes changes to the <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg package manager</a> as part of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2025.03.19">2025.03.19</a> registry release, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/releases/tag/2025-03-13">2025-03-13</a> tool release, as well as changes to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/">vcpkg documentation</a> throughout March. This release includes two new commands for our continuous integration system PR reviews, minor bugfixes, a new documentation article on authenticating to NuGet feeds, and a few other minor documentation fixes.</p>
<p>Some stats for this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now <strong>2,564 total ports </strong>available in the vcpkg curated registry. A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/ports">port is a versioned recipe</a> for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.</li>
<li><strong>40 new ports</strong> were added to the curated registry.</li>
<li><strong>408 ports were updated</strong>. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/triplets">triplets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>82 </strong>community contributors made commits.</li>
<li>The main vcpkg repo has over <strong>6,800 forks</strong> and <strong>24,400 stars</strong> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2>vcpkg changelog (2025.03.19 release)</h2>
<p>The following notable changes were made in March:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added two new commands: <code>x-test-features</code> and <code>format-feature-baseline</code> (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/802">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#802</a>, thanks @autoantwort!).
<ul>
<li><code>x-test-features</code> is an experimental command that runs a series of tests on port features to verify that they work as expected. This will be used as part of our routine continuous integration runs. The commands accept a list of port names or <code>--all</code> to specify which ports are affected. Features which are unsupported or marked as cascade for the target triplet are skipped. The following tests are performed:
<ul>
<li>The core feature gets installed with default features disabled (or <code>--no-core</code>).</li>
<li>Every feature gets installed with default features disabled (or <code>--no-separated</code>).</li>
<li>All features combined get installed (or <code>--no-combined</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>vcpkg format-feature-baseline scripts/ci.feature.baseline.txt</code> formats the feature baseline to enforce that all entries in a “block” are sorted alphabetically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve resiliency of concurrent use of the <em>downloads</em> directory (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1600">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1600</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that impacted debugging with LLDB on MacOS / Apple Silicon (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/1602">Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1602</a>, thanks @ekilmer!).</li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added new article: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/consume/third-party-authentication.nuget">Authenticate to NuGet package feeds</a>. Explains how to use vcpkg features in cases where you need to authenticate to NuGet package feeds, such as for binary caching or asset caching (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/pull/461">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#461</a>).</li>
<li>Reworked <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/asset-caching">Asset caching concepts</a> article and added an example configuration (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/pull/459">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#459</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in an example and minor wording improvements to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/consume/asset-caching">asset caching tutorial</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/examples/asset-caching-source-nuget">asset caching with NuGet tutorial</a> (PR: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/pull/460">Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#460</a>).</li>
<li>Other minor documentation improvements (thanks @autoantwort!).</li>
</ul>

<p>While vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/triplets/community">community triplets</a>), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.</p>

<h2 aria-level="3"><span data-contrast="none">Optimizing IntelliSense Configuration</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">IntelliSense is the core of the C++ Extension, building your coding experience into a dynamic process with real-time analysis and insights. This ranges from autocompletion to file navigation like “Go to Definition”. But in order for IntelliSense to be able to provide this information, it must understand your project’s configuration. Configuration details, such as compiler settings and include paths, are parsed on project startup. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With this release, we optimized the IntelliSense configuration process. The biggest change is that compiler configurations are now cached. A quick retrieval via the database is much faster than identifying and querying the correct compiler every time a project is opened. This leads to faster population of IntelliSense features as seen in the previous section for time to colorization.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have optimized further by parallelizing different processes during file discovery. For example, determining the relationship between source and header files and lookups of different #include files now happen in parallel, providing faster results. Additionally, an updated path canonicalization process for MacOS and Linux uses better path resolutions to standardize file paths. This eliminates redundancies like relative components, reduces file system access, and improves performance across the different operating systems. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond configuring with a compiler, we also optimized the process of using alternate methods for configuration, such as custom configurations. It is now faster to reconfigure a custom configuration provider, and the selected C++ configuration can also now be easily switched within the extension. Switching a configuration is available via a new parameter thanks to the work of </span><a href="https://github.com/adrianstephens"><span data-contrast="none">@adrianstephens</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have also expanded support for configuring your project via a compile_commands.json file. A project can now support multiple compile_command.json file, thanks to the contributions of </span><a href="https://github.com/yiftahw"><span data-contrast="none">@yiftahw</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This makes it easier for build systems that run CMake separately in different repositories to be able to specify which CMake version to use via multiple separate compile_commands files. Additionally, there is now faster processing of large and complex compile_commands.json files, especially for files with thousands of entries. Combined with the new configuration caching, this creates a better startup experience. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Creating a new CMake project that uses unfamiliar libraries can be daunting and time-consuming. This blog post takes you along on my journey using Copilot to make this easier, and leveraging <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=vs-2022#enable-custom-instructions">Custom Instructions</a> to tailor Copilot responses. For a sneak peek, see the outcome of this journey in this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DogDetector">repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As C++ developers who use Copilot every day, we’ve experienced how it can improve our day-to-day productivity. Copilot really shines in scenarios like new codebases or unfamiliar topics, significantly reducing ramp-up. There are multiple ways to engage with it in Visual Studio, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-extension?view=vs-2022">Completions</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat?view=vs-2022">Copilot Chat</a>. This blog is focused on leveraging Copilot Chat to be more productive.</p>
<h3>What project should I create?</h3>
<p>Being a maintainer of the CMake experience, I have always been aware of a popular computer vision library, <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv">OpenCV</a>, that is built on CMake to power 2500+ algorithms. However, I’ve never actually played with it and used it in my own code. The first idea that came to mind, being a dog-lover myself, was to create my own real-time dog detector using OpenCV. I set out to create a Dog Detector using CMake and Copilot in Visual Studio.</p>
<h3>Import OpenCV into CMake Project</h3>
<p>Starting with a new CMake Project in Visual Studio, the first problem to solve was: “How do I import OpenCV into my CMake project?”. Using CMake can sometimes be complex, and I wanted to make sure I used OpenCV in a cross-platform way, so to figure out how to do this, I asked Copilot.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35294 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2-e1742845014677.png" alt="Asking Copilot chat how to use OpenCV in the project" width="918" height="1186" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2-e1742845014677.png 918w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2-e1742845014677-232x300.png 232w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2-e1742845014677-793x1024.png 793w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-v2-e1742845014677-768x992.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></a></p>
<p>Copilot was able to give me CMakeLists.txt modifications that I can make to my project. However, you’ll notice that it mentions that OpenCV must be installed and that I can use vcpkg. <a href="https://vcpkg.io/en/">Vcpkg is a cross-platform C/C++ package manager</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to doing this, while the suggested CMakeLists.txt changes are correct, CMake fails the configure step with an error indicating that OpenCV cannot be found. This is because I haven’t yet installed OpenCV.</p>
<h3>Use vcpkg to install OpenCV</h3>
<p>Now, how do I take Copilot’s suggestion to use vcpkg to install OpenCV? Let’s ask Copilot.</p>
<p>Copilot gave the following response:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-opencv.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35297" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-opencv.png" alt="Image vcpkg opencv" width="908" height="582" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll notice that it gave only command-line suggestions for how to install OpenCV with vcpkg. Our team typically uses vcpkg in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/manifest-mode">manifest mode</a> and I’d prefer to use that. Also, you’ll notice that Copilot suggested a CMake command line. We are in Visual Studio, so the command line is driven by our CMake Presets file, and I’d rather make modifications there.</p>
<p>Let’s ask Copilot again with those requests in mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px; text-align: right;"><em> </em><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Hm, wouldn’t it be nice if I didn’t have to specify manifest mode?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />It would also be nice if I didn’t have to specify that I prefer using CMakePresets.json when I ask Copilot questions? </em></p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-manifest.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35298" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/vcpkg-manifest.png" alt="Asking Copilot how to use vcpkg in manifest mode to install openCV" width="1809" height="789" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These suggestions are much more aligned with what I’d like to do in my project. Following a combination of the Copilot suggestions and this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vs?pivots=shell-powershell">documentation</a>, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installed vcpkg and ran the bootstrap script.</li>
<li>Created the necessary vcpkg.json and vcpkg-configuration.json files defining opencv as a dependency.</li>
<li>Modified the <code>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</code> using the CMakePresets file.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, we were closer, but we still failed to configure. After asking Copilot for help, I realized that it wasn’t finding the toolchain file, and that I should specify the <code>VCPKG_ROOT</code> in an environment variable in the preset and use that variable in the <code>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</code> setting to successfully find it.</p>
<p>At this point, CMake configured successfully and OpenCV had been included in my CMake project.</p>
<h3>Use OpenCV to detect dogs</h3>
<p>Now that OpenCV was properly included in my CMake project, the next step was to figure out how to use the library and how to get it to detect dogs. From my little background knowledge of OpenCV, I knew that it would need a model trained to detect certain objects. To start, I asked Copilot if OpenCV can detect dogs already, and it told me that there were already publicly available models and, upon further questioning, pointed me to some links where I could download configuration files, weights files, and class names from <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I had downloaded models I could use, I asked Copilot to give me a code snippet that would allow me to detect dogs.</p>
<p>One thing that I hit errors on and had to modify was that Copilot suggested relative paths, and this didn’t work, since it was running the executable from the build location. I found it easier to always use absolute paths to make this simpler.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/absolute-paths.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35299" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/absolute-paths.png" alt="Asking Copilot to modify paths to absolute paths." width="890" height="297" /></a></p>

<p>After modifying the paths, I was able to detect dogs in images!</p>

<h3>Switch to livestream</h3>
<p>I didn’t want to only be able to detect dogs in images, I also wanted to be able to detect dogs using a livestream. I went back to Copilot and asked it to help me make these changes: “How can I modify this code to livestream from a camera rather than reading a single image?”.</p>
<p>Copilot was able to suggest slight modifications to the code, and I was able to integrate a while loop and slightly modify the camera capture mechanism to accomplish this. See the original code versus the suggested livestream code below.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35301 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream-e1742845270306.png" alt="Copilot helps suggest code to read from a livestream context." width="1306" height="678" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream-e1742845270306.png 1306w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream-e1742845270306-300x156.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream-e1742845270306-1024x532.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/livestream-e1742845270306-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px" /></a></p>
<p>To my surprise, the model could detect other objects as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/9.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35279 size-full" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/9.png" alt="Image 9" width="339" height="271" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/9.png 339w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/9-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /></a></p>
<h3>Add UI</h3>
<p>To make a more well-rounded application, I wanted to add a user interface to make it easier to control what models are used and to make it easier to operate overall. Through some conversations with Copilot, I was able to add qt5 as a vcpkg.json dependency and add components that allow you to select the .cfg, the .weights, the class names file, and to start and stop the livestream.</p>
<p>The below partial screenshot shows the initial suggestions that copilot gave:</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35314" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot.png" alt="Image FixBlurryScreenshot" width="1336" height="552" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot.png 1336w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot-300x124.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot-1024x423.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/FixBlurryScreenshot-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1336px) 100vw, 1336px" /></a></p>
<p>After refining the UI with more conversation with UI and code improvements, the pictures below show The Dog Detector when the camera isn’t on versus when it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35303" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector.png" alt="Image person dog detector" width="751" height="416" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector.png 1696w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector-300x166.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector-1024x567.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector-768x425.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/person-dog-detector-1536x850.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p>Also, the ultimate test was to test out the “Dog Detector” with my dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Dog.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35313" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Dog.gif" alt="GIF of a dog " width="400" height="441" /></a></p>
<h3>Build the project statically</h3>
<p>Finally, I wanted to be able to share the executable of this project easily with others so that they could use this project without having to worry about the runtime, the build process, etc. To do this, I asked Copilot: “How to statically link a library with CMake and vcpkg?”</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/static-link.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35305" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/static-link.png" alt="Asking Copilot how to Static link a library using vcpkg" width="561" height="970" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/static-link.png 685w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/static-link-173x300.png 173w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/static-link-592x1024.png 592w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a></p>
<p>Copilot gave a suggestion to set the vcpkg triplet, but it gave suggestions to modify it in CMakeLists.txt or in the command line. To get better suggestions, I asked again, adding that we want to modify the CMakePresets.json.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />This is another instance where it’d be nice to not have to specify this every time I ask.</em></p>
<p>I took these suggestions and modified them to use CMakePresets.json, so I set the <code>VCPKG_TRIPLET_TARGET</code> in CMakePresets.json.</p>
<p>With these changes, configuration succeeded, but I still got the following build errors:</p>
<pre>mismatch detected for ‘RuntimeLibrary’: value ‘MTd_StaticDebug’ doesn’t match value ‘MDd_DynamicDebug’ in DogDetector.cpp.obj.</pre>
<p>To help me fix this problem, I asked Copilot to help. Copilot told me to ensure I set the variable <code>OpenCV_STATIC</code> to <code>ON</code>. Since this variable is specific to only the target that includes OpenCV, I set this in the CMakeLists.txt. Additionally, CMake told me that I should set the <code>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</code> to <code>MultiThreaded$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:Debug&gt;</code>. However, after making these changes, I was still getting the error.</p>
<p>After much conversation with Copilot, I realized it may have something to do with CMake Policies associated with the <code>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</code>. Looking at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html">documentation</a>, the variable only takes effect when the CMP0091 policy is set to “new”, which is only “new” by default in version 3.15 and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />It would have been great to be informed about CMake Policies that affect CMake variables that Copilot suggested I use.</em></p>
<p>After updating the CMake project to have a minimum required version of 3.15, the project built statically with no errors.</p>
<h3>Custom Instructions</h3>
<p>After completing the project, looking back at all the questions and interactions I had with Copilot through Copilot Chat, there were many times where I thought, “Hm, it would be great if I didn’t have to continually specify this information in each question.”. You may have noticed this internal dialog above.</p>
<p>To solve this, I used the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui">Copilot Custom Instructions feature.</a> This feature allows you to create a .github/copilot-instructions.md file that contains additional context you want to be added to every question that you ask Copilot Chat.</p>
<p>Based on the various observations I made, I created a copilot-instructions.md file and added the following custom instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>This project uses vcpkg in manifest mode. Please keep this in mind when giving vcpkg suggestions. Do not provide suggestions like vcpkg install library, as they will not work as expected.</li>
<li>Prefer setting cache variables and other types of things through CMakePresets.json if possible.</li>
<li>Give information about any CMake Policies that might affect CMake variables that are suggested or mentioned.</li>
<li>This project needs to be cross-platform and cross-compiler for MSVC, Clang, and GCC.</li>
<li>When providing OpenCV samples that use the file system to read files, please always use absolute file paths rather than file names, or relative file paths. For example, use <code>video.open("C:/project/file.mp4")</code>, not <code>video.open("file.mp4")</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After adding this file, it was immediately obvious that answers were better when asking the same questions that had been asked previously. For example, I created a new project again and asked how I should use vcpkg to use OpenCV with CMake, and this is part of the response I received.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/new-vcpkg-opencv.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35306" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/new-vcpkg-opencv.png" alt="Now asking vcpkg to open openCV with custom instructions provides tailored results." width="669" height="929" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/new-vcpkg-opencv.png 765w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/new-vcpkg-opencv-216x300.png 216w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/new-vcpkg-opencv-738x1024.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></a></p>
<p>I was able to repeat the process of creating this project, and by utilizing the Custom Instructions feature, it took me far fewer iterations with Copilot to get answers that I wanted when asking questions related to the custom instructions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>By utilizing the CMake experience along with Copilot in Visual Studio, I was able to quickly get a Dog Detector program up and running, complete with vcpkg integration, an easy-to-use UI, and static linking to share the executable.</p>
<p>I was also able to use the Custom Instructions feature provided by Copilot to make my conversations more useful without having to provide as much repetitive, contextual information in each message to Copilot.</p>
<p>Copilot helped me speed up my development process by answering my questions and helping me navigate CMake and vcpkg. Custom instructions helped Copilot provide more relevant and straightforward answers, without me having to take the time to provide additional context in every question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 5 years, we’ve had many incredible opportunities to engage with game developers. From AAA studios to indie developers, the passion for slashing iteration times is significant. Amidst all the fantastic feedback we&#8217;ve received for Visual Studio, one sentiment has rung loud and clear: a desire to debug optimized C++ code without sacrificing performance. Although game developers have voiced this need the loudest, we know that solving this issue will benefit many other C++ workflows. While we&#8217;ve consistently rolled out <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/unreal-engine-cpp-game-development-made-easy-visual-studio-2022/">many</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/partnering-with-the-coalition/">productivity</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/unreal-engine-cpp-game-development-made-easy-visual-studio-2022/">and</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/faster-cpp-source-code-indexing/">performance</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/directly-edit-unreal-engine-projects-in-visual-studio-2022/">enhancements</a> <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/02/a-year-of-game-development-improvements-in-visual-studio-2022/">over the years</a>, debugging optimized code has always been at the top of everyone&#8217;s wish list.</p>
<h2>Current Issues with Debugging Optimized Code</h2>
<p>Through our conversations with game developers, we’ve heard about some common problems when debugging optimized code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to inspect locals often yields the &#8220;Variable is optimized away&#8221; message in the watch window.</li>
<li>Step-over and step-into don&#8217;t always step over, or into, the expected code paths.</li>
<li>Losing time while iterating with #pragma optimize to try and undo optimizations, requiring a rebuild and restart of the debugger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, the team has been hard at work to come up with a creative solution.</p>
<h2>Announcing: C++ Dynamic Debugging</h2>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that C++ Dynamic Debugging is now available as a <em>preview</em> feature exclusively with the MSVC toolset. This feature dynamically deoptimizes code that you set breakpoints on or step into, giving you the performance of optimized code with the debugging experience of unoptimized code.</p>
<p>Try C++ Dynamic Debugging today in <strong>Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 Preview 2</strong>.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with C++ Dynamic Debugging</h2>
<p>You only need a few short clicks to turn on C++ Dynamic Debugging for your project. After activating these options, you must rebuild to start using C++ Dynamic Debugging.</p>
<h3>MSBuild C++ Projects</h3>
<p>To begin, change your configuration to Release mode. Next, right-click on your project and click on Properties to open the Configuration Properties menu. In this menu, click on <em>Advanced</em> &gt; <em>Use C++ Dynamic Debugging</em> &gt; <strong>Yes</strong>. Lastly, rebuild your project.</p>
<p>Setting this property will turn off Whole Program Optimization.</p>

<h3>Other Build Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pass the new <em>/dynamicdeopt</em> switch to <em>cl.exe, lib.exe, and link.exe</em></li>
<li>For Unreal Engine developers, UE 5.6 will support the <em>bDynamicDebugging</em> Windows platform flag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="https://aka.ms/vcdd">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2022 Version 17.14 Preview 2</li>
<li>MSVC Toolset 19.44</li>
<li>X64 architecture</li>
<li>Not compatible with LTCG, PGO, OPT-ICF flags</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using C++ Dynamic Debugging</h2>
<p>Turning on C++ Dynamic Debugging and rebuilding unlocks familiar debugging patterns for optimized code without compromising on performance.</p>
<h3>Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Your breakpoints will get hit in deoptimized code. Look for the [Deoptimized] tag in the Call Stack window to know that you can view all your locals.</p>
<h3>Conditional and Dependent Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Set Conditional and Dependent Breakpoints as if the code was unoptimized; you can add conditional breakpoints to variables that have been optimized away in your optimized binaries.</p>
<h3>Stepping Actions</h3>
<p>Step Over to the next line of your source code as if the code was unoptimized.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_35237" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_35237" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/step-over.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35237" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/step-over.png" alt="Image step over in visual studio" width="235" height="92" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_35237" class="wp-caption-text">Stepping Actions</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Step In to any function, and those functions will be deoptimized as well. In addition, Step In will now step into <em>__forceinline</em> functions.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_35238" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_35238" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/forceinline.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35238" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/forceinline.png" alt="Image forceinline code in lyra sample project" width="561" height="114" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/forceinline.png 561w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/forceinline-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_35238" class="wp-caption-text">Step Into __forceinline functions</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Set Next Statement</h3>
<p>Using Set Next Statement in a deoptimized frame works as if the code was unoptimized.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_35239" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_35239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/set-next-statement.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35239" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/set-next-statement.png" alt="Image set next statement" width="524" height="172" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/set-next-statement.png 524w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/set-next-statement-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_35239" class="wp-caption-text">Set Next Statement</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Call Stack Window</h3>
<p>In your Call Stack window, you will see that any frames that have been deoptimized will have a <em>[Deoptimized]</em> tag.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_35242" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_35242" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/call-stack-window.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35242" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/call-stack-window.png" alt="Image call stack window" width="421" height="179" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/call-stack-window.png 421w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/call-stack-window-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_35242" class="wp-caption-text">Call Stack Window</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Visual Studio only deoptimizes the frame corresponding to your breakpoint or functions stepped into. Frames higher up in the call stack remain optimized for performance. You can select additional frames in the Call Stack window and click “<em>Deoptimize on next entry</em>” to deoptimize those functions when they are entered the next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptnextentry.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35241" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptnextentry.png" alt="Image deoptnextentry" width="418" height="184" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptnextentry.png 418w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptnextentry-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></a></p>
<h3>Managing &#8220;Deoptimize on next entry&#8221; breakpoints</h3>
<p>Breakpoints added through &#8220;<em>Deoptimize on next entry</em>&#8221; are listed in the Breakpoints window. You can export these Breakpoints for later use. To return your application to full optimization, delete these breakpoints.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_35240" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_35240" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptbps.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35240" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptbps.png" alt="Image deoptbps" width="408" height="224" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptbps.png 408w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/deoptbps-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_35240" class="wp-caption-text">Deoptimized Breakpoints</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Middleware Support</h2>
<p>We have been working closely with our middleware partners to ensure that C++ Dynamic Debugging works with popular middleware tools.</p>
<h3>Unreal Engine</h3>
<p>In Unreal Engine version 5.6, Unreal Build Tool and Unreal Build Accelerator will support C++ Dynamic Debugging natively. To try the feature today, please manually apply the <a href="http://aka.ms/vcdd_ue">change</a>, temporarily disable Unreal Build Accelerator, and see our <a href="https://aka.ms/vcdd">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>IncrediBuild</h3>
<p>IncrediBuild 10.24 or later supports C++ Dynamic Debugging.</p>
<h3>FastBuild</h3>
<p>FastBuild support for C++ Dynamic Debugging is now available in the <em>dev</em> branch, please see this <a href="https://aka.ms/vcdd_fastbuild">Pull Request</a>. Official support will be available in the upcoming v1.15.</p>
<h3>Xbox GDK</h3>
<p>Out-of-the-box support for C++ Dynamic Debugging will be available in an April 2025 update. To try this feature today, please refer to the official GDK documentation.</p>
<h2>Overhead Considerations</h2>
<p>While using C++ Dynamic Debugging, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge the following considerations. Despite these overhead costs, we are confident that your overall iteration time will benefit significantly.</p>
<h3>File Output Size</h3>
<p>In our assessments, using a modified version of the Lyra Sample project, we observed a 2.4x increase in the build output size.</p>
<h3>Build Time</h3>
<h4>End-to-end Build Time</h4>
<p>Depending on the project, we saw an increase in end-to-end build time ranging from 1.05x to 1.15x.</p>
<h4>Iteration Build Time</h4>
<p>For small and medium-sized binaries, the increase in iteration build time was less than 1.2x. For larger binaries, such as monolithic games, the increase was up to 1.8x.</p>
<h4>Mitigations for Iteration Build Time</h4>
<p>If the increase in iteration time is too burdensome for large binaries, you can try the undocumented /d2DDTrimInlines compiler switch. This switch, subject-to-change and removal, reduces the iteration time overhead from 1.8x to 1.4x at the cost of increased end-to-end build time. The switch also removes the ability to step into small __forceinline/inline functions.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slow build times are a major headache for developers, especially in large, complex C++ codebases like game engines. Every minute spent waiting on a build is time that could be used to refine features, resolve issues, or push development forward. Activision faced this challenge with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, where prolonged build times were slowing down iteration and impeding workflows. By leveraging Build Insights, they identified key inefficiencies, optimized bottlenecks, and successfully reduced build times from 27:49 minutes to just 14:25 minutes—cutting them in half. Read more about their journey in our detailed breakdown on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-build-insights-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="696" data-end="758">Microsoft Game Dev</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full" src="https://press.activision.com/content/dam/atvi/activision/atvi-touchui/press/assets/call-of-duty/modern-warfare-ii/beta/screenshots/Sa%27id_General_Action_1.png" alt="Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II Action Image" width="3840" height="2160" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Build times impact every aspect of development. When builds are slow, valuable engineering time is lost—time that could be spent improving features, optimizing performance, or debugging critical issues. Slow builds also create bottlenecks in our continuous integration pipelines, delaying the verification of every piece of code and content that goes into our games. To keep our development workflow efficient, we need our builds to be as fast as possible, and Build Insights provides that capability to our teams. — Michael Vance, SVP &amp; Fellow Software Engineer, Activision</p></blockquote>
<p>Through a collaboration between Activision, the Xbox Advanced Technology Group (ATG), and the MSVC team, optimizations were made to force inlining, linker efficiency, and whole-program analysis, leading to dramatic improvements in build performance. These insights not only benefited Call of Duty but also contributed to broader enhancements in MSVC’s LTCG and linker performance, positively impacting other major projects like Fortnite, Chrome, and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>To dive deeper into how these optimizations were achieved and how Build Insights can help your own development workflow, read the full article on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-build-insights-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/">How Build Insights Reduced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II’s Build Times by 50%</a>.

<a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">C++ Core Guidelines</a>.
It provides types and functions that help C++ developers write safer, more maintainable
code while following modern C++ best practices.</em></p>
<p>We are excited to announce the release of GSL v4.2.0! This release brings significant
performance improvements, new features, and important updates that align GSL with modern
C++ standards.</p>
<h2>Performance Boost for Span Iterator</h2>
<p>One of the most notable changes in this release is the significant performance
improvements of <code>span_iterator</code> when using the Clang compiler. Previously, <code>gsl::span</code>
iterators could be up to 20 times slower than <code>std::span</code> under various workloads
(range-for, <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code>, etc.). Through reorganization of the code and moving
access-checks out of the hot path, we have achieved performance parity for most
workloads (see <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL/issues/1168">#1168</a>). This
ABI-preserving improvement makes <code>gsl::span</code> a more practical choice for code that is
both safe and fast.</p>
<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p>As the C++ Core Guidelines evolve with modern C++ practices, GSL continues to adapt and
grow. Working closely with the community, we&#8217;ve implemented key enhancements that make
GSL more robust and easier to use in modern C++ codebases. These updates focus on type
safety, modern idioms, and better template support — areas crucial for production
code. Here are some of the key improvements since version 4.1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GSL Swap Support</strong>: Introduced <code>gsl::swap</code> specifically designed for safely swapping
<code>gsl::not_null</code> pointers</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Type Traits</strong>: Added <code>element_type</code> to <code>gsl::not_null&lt;T&gt;</code> for better type
trait consistency</li>
<li><strong>Improved Smart Pointer Support</strong>: Added support for <code>strict_not_null</code> with
<code>unique_ptr</code></li>
<li><strong>Better SFINAE</strong>: Improved template substitution behavior throughout the library</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alignment with C++ Standards</h2>
<p>As part of our commitment to keeping GSL aligned with modern C++ development, we are
deprecating features that have been adopted into the C++ standard library. We recommend
using the C++ standard library equivalents for these features when possible. Here are
the features that have been deprecated in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gsl::unique_ptr</code></li>
<li><code>gsl::shared_ptr</code></li>
<li><code>gsl::byte</code> (for C++17 and later)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we have removed the long-deprecated <code>string_span</code> feature, encouraging
users to migrate to <code>std::string_view</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We continue to recommend using <code>gsl::span</code> as a safer alternative to
<code>std::span</code>.</p>
<h2>Compatibility Updates</h2>
<p>We want to make sure GSL runs well on the latest compilers and modern operating systems.
To that end, we have modernized our build infrastructure to validate that GSL is
supported by the latest development environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated compiler support to include Clang 16 to 18 and GCC 12 to 14</li>
<li>Upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04 in our CI pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about our supported platforms can be found in our
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes and Standards Compliance</h2>
<p>Several important bugs have been fixed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolved a GCC-specific issue with list initialization of const references</li>
<li>Fixed SFINAE implementation in <code>gsl::owner</code></li>
<li>Improved include directive handling to prevent conflicts with standard library headers</li>
<li>Updated include paths to comply with C++ Core Guidelines</li>
</ul>
