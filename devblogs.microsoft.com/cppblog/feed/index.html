										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to share that starting with the <code>2023-06-22</code> release of vcpkg-tool (vcpkg <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/commit/8f3e8d6e95c7f91edea60c47a7d1414ab5ca9492">commit SHA 8f3e8d6</a>), vcpkg has an experimental feature to provide data to the GitHub dependency graph. We are actively developing this feature and would like to hear your feedback. Let us know if you have any thoughts about the current functionality or would like to see further improvements. If you have feedback on any of the GitHub features that a vcpkg-powered dependency graph enables, let us know that too and we&#8217;ll make sure that it reaches the right folks at GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-github-dependency-graph">About the GitHub dependency graph</h2>
<p>The GitHub <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph">dependency graph</a> stores the set of dependencies for a repository. Beyond just being able to visualize what a repository&#8217;s dependencies are, GitHub builds several useful features on top of this data, including <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review">dependency review</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts">Dependabot alerts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="enabling-the-github-dependency-graph">Enabling the GitHub dependency graph</h3>
<p>Enabling the dependency graph for your repository is a requirement for vcpkg to be able to populate the dependencies for your repository. The dependency graph is enabled by default for public repositories on GitHub. If you want the dependency graph enabled for a private repository, you should follow the <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/configuring-the-dependency-graph#enabling-and-disabling-the-dependency-graph-for-a-private-repository">GitHub documentation to enable the dependency graph</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/github-enable-dependencygraph.png" alt="Screenshot showing the button to enable the dependency graph" /></p>
<p>If you are already using reusable actions in your GitHub Actions workflows and the dependency graph is enabled, there&#8217;s a good chance your repository&#8217;s dependency graph already has some dependencies listed. Check it out by selecting <strong>Insights</strong> for your repository and then selecting <strong>Dependency graph</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/github-insights-dependencygraph.png" alt="Screenshot of a sample repository's dependency graph" /></p>
<h3 id="techniques-for-populating-the-dependency-graph">Techniques for populating the dependency graph</h3>
<p>There are two ways that the dependency graph may get populated. For some package management systems that have a static list of dependencies that can be fully described in a manifest file, GitHub will automatically scan those manifests once they are pushed into your repository and will begin showing up in the dependency graph.</p>
<p>For package management systems that are more dynamic, the tools used to process the list of dependencies must be involved in determining the complete set of dependencies. The complete set of dependencies for C and C++ are usually highly dependent upon build configuration and target platform. For these ecosystems, GitHub has a <a href="https://docs.github.com/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission">dependency submission API</a> that tools can use to provide the dependency information, usually as a part of a GitHub Actions workflow job.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-dependencies-with-vcpkg">Reporting dependencies with vcpkg</h2>
<p>vcpkg integration with the GitHub dependency graph can be enabled by adding the value <code>dependencygraph</code> to the <code>VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS</code> environment variable within your GitHub Actions workflow file that runs vcpkg (either directly or indirectly via CMake). You must also modify your workflow file to set the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable with the value <code>${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}</code> and request permission for the workflow job to write the dependency information into your repository&#8217;s metadata by including the following YAML snippet near the top of your workflow file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-YAML">permissions:
  contents: write</code></pre>
<p>Once those changes have been made, and your workflow runs again, you should begin to see the dependencies in your vcpkg.json manifest listed in the <strong>Dependency graph</strong> section on GitHub.</p>
<p>See our documentation at <a href="https://aka.ms/vcpkg-dependency-graph">GitHub integration &#8211; The GitHub dependency graph</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://aka.ms/vcpkg-dependency-graph-example">live example template repository</a> is on GitHub if you want to try it out in a clean project. If you want to try it out on an existing project, see the workflow files defined below that shows the changes you need to make to enable the feature.</p>
<p>Both workflow examples below work with the <code>vcpkg.json</code> and <code>main.cpp</code> files listed here.</p>

        "¡Hola, Mundo!\n"
    );
}</code></pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/microsoft-cpp-code-analysis-warnings-with-key-events/">MSVC&#8217;s Code Analysis Key Events</a> are a useful tool for quickly getting to the root-cause of your static analysis warnings. This blog post highlights how Key Events may be used with warning <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/code-quality/c26800?view=msvc-170"><code>C26800</code></a> <code>Use of a moved from object</code> to quickly narrow down the problematic code.</p>
<h2 id="c26800-warning-recap">C26800 warning recap</h2>
<p>Warning C26800 catches code that attempts to use an object that is in a moved-from state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
    std::string string_owner = "this string will be moved!";
    std::string new_string_owner = std::move(string_owner);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; string_owner &lt;&lt; std::endl; // Warning C26800 Use of a moved from object: ''string_owner'' (lifetime.1).
}</code></pre>
<p>Instead of <code>this string will be moved!</code>, the print statement in the above example will produce an empty output line when run.</p>
<p>The move from <code>string_owner</code> into <code>new_string_owner</code> happens on the line <em>immediately</em> preceding its use in the print statement, so it&#8217;s instantly clear why the output is incorrect. But this is a trivial example. Real world code is rarely this straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-complex-example-sans-key-events">A more complex example, sans Key Events</h2>
<p>Consider a more convoluted example. The following code defines a function that is not only significantly longer than in the first code snippet, but is also littered with all sorts of intervening business logic (represented by <code>// ...</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;string&gt;
void take_ownership(std::string&amp;&amp;) { /* ... */ }
void use_string(std::string) { /* ... */ }
void my_buggy_function(bool some_condition, bool some_other_condition)
{
    std::string my_string{ "this is a string!" };
    bool my_flag{ false };

    // ...

    if (some_condition)
    {
        take_ownership(std::move(my_string)); // (a)
    }

    // ...

    if (some_other_condition) // (b)
    {
        my_flag = true;

        // ...

        my_string = "the string is reset"; // (c)

        // ...
    }

    // ...

    if (my_flag &amp;&amp; !some_other_condition) // (d)
    {
        take_ownership(std::move(my_string)); // (e)
    }

    // ...

    use_string(my_string); // Use of a moved from object: ''my_string'' (lifetime.1). (f)
}</code></pre>
<p>As in the simple example, a developer tasked with solving this bug will be looking to answer the question: where is <code>my_string</code> moved? A natural approach would likely be to start on line <code>(f)</code>, and to scan backwards through the code. This process would look something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting at the warning location and looking a few lines up, the <code>take_ownership(std::move(my_string));</code> on line <code>(e)</code> immediately offers itself up as the culprit. To realize that this is a red-herring requires evaluating the condition on line <code>(d)</code>, which requires tracing even higher up into the function&#8217;s depths, delving further into the confusing business logic.</li>
<li>Eventually, once satisfied that the move on line <code>(e)</code> is actually unreachable (oops!), the developer recommences the upwards traversal, eventually landing on the <code>move</code> on line <code>(a)</code>. But not before noticing the write to <code>my_string</code> on line <code>(c)</code>.</li>
<li>The developer must now solve the puzzle of why this re-assignment (on line <code>(c)</code>) is not preventing the warning all the way down on line <code>(f)</code>.</li>
<li>After spending far too long running back and forth through the code, the developer finally convinces themselves that it might be possible for the condition on line <code>(b)</code> to be false, thus skipping the reset on line <code>(c)</code>. The mystery is finally solved.</li>
</ul>
<p>There must be an easier way. Enter Key Events.</p>
<h2 id="solution-made-simple-with-key-events">Solution made simple with Key Events</h2>
<p>As of Visual Studio 17.5 Preview 1, Key Events have been enabled for the warning C26800. Using the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/microsoft-cpp-code-analysis-warnings-with-key-events/#presentation-of-key-events-through-sarif-viewer-extension">Microsoft SARIF Viewer extension</a>, this check can now precisely explain its assumptions and reasoning to the curious developer, all via inline annotations in the buggy code!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/sarif_extension.png" alt="Key Events with warning C26800" /></p>
<p>These Key Events offer precisely the troublesome code path that the developer was searching for and (eventually) arrived at via manual inspection of the function&#8217;s code. Notably, we see that the check:</p>
<ul>
<li>is concerned with the move on line <code>(a)</code>, helpfully noting that its guarding condition <code>some_condition</code> could be <code>true</code></li>
<li>points out that there is nothing stopping the conditions on line <code>(b)</code> and <code>(d)</code> from being <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The buggy control flow leading to the usage of the moved-from <code>my_string</code> variable is therefore immediately made clear to the satisfied developer, and the investigation time is greatly reduced.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Prior to the addition of Key Events to MSVC&#8217;s warning C26800, complex code made it hard to debug and get to the root-cause of the warning. Now, with Key Events enabled by default for warning C26800, developers can much more easily identify and resolve instances of use-after-free warnings in their code. This feature was enabled in Visual Studio 17.5 Preview 1, so please <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/">download a recent version</a> and try it out. You can share your thoughts and comments with us through <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/cpp">Developer Community</a>, Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/visualc">@VisualC</a>), or via email at <a href="mailto:visualcpp@microsoft.com">visualcpp@microsoft.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-insights-with-included-files-view">Parsing Insights with Included Files View</h3>
<p>In the Included Files View, you&#8217;ll see how each file contributes to the overall build time, determined by the number of times it is parsed. Files that take up 10% or more of the build time will be marked with a flame symbol that indicates priority files for troubleshooting. You can optimize these files using methods like implementing precompiled headers or minimizing unnecessary inclusions. You can refer to this blogpost for a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/faster-builds-with-pch-suggestions-from-c-build-insights/">precompiled header optimization</a>.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_32377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32377" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-32377 size-large" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719-1024x399.png" alt="Image Included Files View" width="640" height="249" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719-1024x399.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719-300x117.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719-768x299.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719-1536x599.png 1536w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludedFiles-e1686789822719.png 1850w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32377" class="wp-caption-text">Include Files View: The flame icon indicates that the file might be a bottleneck.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3 id="diving-deeper-with-include-tree-view">Diving Deeper with Include Tree View</h3>
<p>Include Tree View offers a more granular perspective of your project. It presents the #included hierarchy of all the files in the trace, providing a crystal-clear view of your project&#8217;s structure and highlighting potential areas for improvement. From any view, you can access the selected file by double clicking, pressing enter, or from the context menu of the selected table entry.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_32391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32391" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789145438.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-32391 size-large" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789576414-1024x576.png" alt="A view of the Include Tree in Build Insights Analysis" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789576414-1024x576.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789576414-300x169.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789576414-768x432.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/IncludeTreeView-e1686789576414.png 1282w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32391" class="wp-caption-text">Include Tree View: File entries can be expanded to show #included files within that entry.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3 id="navigation-simplified">Navigation Simplified</h3>
<p>You can navigate to source files by using the context menu, double-clicking, or pressing Enter in any table entry. Also, for those moments when you want to switch your perspective, we added the &#8220;Show in [View]&#8221; option. This functionality enables you to seamlessly transition between the Included Files View and Include Tree View.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_32394" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32394" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-32394 size-large" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation-1024x528.png" alt="You can right click on a file in the Included Tree view to navigate to source file" width="640" height="330" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation-1024x528.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation-300x155.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation-768x396.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Navigation.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32394" class="wp-caption-text">Context Menu: You can navigate to source or go to the associated entry in another view.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3 id="designed-for-everyone">Designed for Everyone</h3>
<p>One of the main principles guiding the design of Build Insights is the aim to simplify the process of capturing and visualizing information within the same platform. Nevertheless, based on feedback, we know some users still would like to use WPA to go deeper in their investigation. We simplified that workflow by bundling WPA with the C++ workloads and added a button to open the trace directly within Visual Studio.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_32395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32395" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-32395 size-large" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button-1024x766.png" alt="Open in WPA button is located on the bottom right corner of the Build Insights Analysis window" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button-1024x766.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button-300x224.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button-768x574.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/WPA-Button.png 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32395" class="wp-caption-text">You can open WPA from within the Build Insights analysis window.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Additionally, you can open the dialog by navigation at any time to Project &gt; Install WSL for me.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a WSL machine already installed on your machine, an additional option will be available in your Target Machine dropdown to &#8220;Create Linux Environment.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h3>
<p>Once you click one of these options, an installation dialog will pop up. In the installation dialog, it will automatically check the status of pre-requisites on your machine for the installation and populate additional information if anything needs pre-configuring. You can hover over the question mark icon to learn more information about each pre-requisite check. If any pre-requisite fails, you can follow the error information to fix the errors, and then select &#8220;Refresh System Check Values&#8221; to re-run the pre-requisite checks.</p>

<p>After the pre-requisites are run and all pass, the installation process will kick off.</p>

<p>At the end, you can select &#8220;Finish&#8221; and the new WSL machine with build tools downloaded will be selected as the target machine for your existing CMake project.</p>
<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h3>
<p>We will be planning on adding additional tutorial content to open the installer, additional information messaging and customization, and the installer will automatically re-open after reboot of machine. Let us know if there’s anything else you’d like to see!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think">What do you think?</h3>
<p>We hope this new WSL acquisition experience will help you install and re-target your applications to WSL. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/">Download the latest preview version of Visual Studio</a> and give it a try.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the last couple of months, the Microsoft C++ team has been working on improving MSVC ARM64 backend performance and we are excited to have a couple of optimizations available in the </span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-17-6-now-available/"><span data-contrast="none">Visual Studio 2022 version 1</span><span data-contrast="none">7.6</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. These optimizations improved code-generation for both scalar ISA and SIMD ISA (NEON). Let’s review some interesting optimizations in this blog.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before diving into technical details, we&#8217;d encourage you to create feedback here at </span><a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/cpp"><span data-contrast="none">Developer Community</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> if you have found performance issues. The feedback helps us prioritize work items in our backlog. This, </span><a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/arm64-backend-neon-optimize-neon-rig/10146259?q=backend+neon"><span data-contrast="none">optimize neon right shift into cmp</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, is an example of good feedback. Including a tagged subject title, detailed description of the issue, and a simple repro simplifies our analysis work and helps us deliver a fix more quickly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, let&#8217;s see the optimizations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2 id="auto-vectorizer-supports-more-neon-instructions-with-asymmetric-operands">Auto-Vectorizer supports more NEON instructions with asymmetric operands</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The ARM64 backend already supports some NEON instructions with asymmetric typed operands, like Add/Subtract Long operations (SADDL/UADDL/SSUBL/USUBL). These instructions add each vector element in the lower or upper half of the first source SIMD register to the corresponding vector element of the second source SIMD register and write the vector result to the destination SIMD register. The destination vector elements are twice as long as the source vector elements. Now, we have extended such support to Multiply-Add Long and Multiply-Subtract Long (<code>SMLAL</code>/<code>UMLAL</code>/<code>SMLSL</code>/<code>UMLSL</code>).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">void smlal(int * __restrict dst, int * __restrict a, 
           short * __restrict b, short * __restrict c) 
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) 
        dst[i] = a[i] + b[i] * c[i]; 
} </code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Visual Studio 2022 17.5, the code-generation was:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">sxtl        v19.4s,v16.4h 
sxtl        v18.4s,v17.4h 
mla         v20.4s,v18.4s,v19.4s </code><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Extra signed extensions are performed on both source operands to match the type of destination. Now it has been optimized into a single </span><code>smlal v16.4s,v17.4h,v18.4h</code><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The ARM64 ISA further supports another variant for these operations, which is called Add/Subtract Wide. For them, the </span><span data-contrast="none">asymmetry happens between source operands, not between source and destination.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">void saddw(int *__restrict dst, int *__restrict a, short *__restrict b) 
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) 
        dst[i] = a[i] + b[i]; 
}</code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Visual Studio 2022 17.5, the code-generation was:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">sxtl        v17.4s,v16.4h 
add         v18.4s,v17.4s,v18.4s  </code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The narrow source gets extra signed extension to match the other wide source. In the 17.6 release, this has been optimized into a single </span><code>saddw v16.4s,v16.4s,v17.4h</code><span data-contrast="auto">. The same applies to <code>UADDW</code>/<code>SSUBW</code>/<code>USUBW</code>.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2 id="auto-vectorizer-now-supports-small-types-on-abs-min-max">Auto-vectorizer now supports small types on <code>ABS</code>/<code>MIN</code>/<code>MAX</code><code><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></code></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><code>ABS</code>/<code>MIN</code>/<code>MAX</code> have slightly complex semantics. Normally, the compiler middle-end or back-end will have a pattern matcher to recognize IR sequences with if-then-else semantics and see if they could be converted into <code>ABS</code>/<code>MIN</code>/<code>MAX</code>. There is an issue when the operands are in small types (int8 or int16) though.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">As specified by the C++ standard, small types are promoted to <code>int</code>, which is 32-bit on ARM64. This is perfect for scalar operations because they really can only operate on scalar register width. For ARM64, the smallest width is 32-bit utilizing the sub-register. However, this is not true for SIMD ISA whose minimum operation width is the width of vector lane (element). For example, ARM64 NEON supports operating on int8, int16 for a couple of operations including <code>ABS</code>/<code>MIN</code>/<code>MAX</code>. So, to generate SIMD instructions operating on small element sizes and deliver higher computing throughput, the auto-vectorizer needs to do analysis and narrow the type back to the original small type when it is safe to do so.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On top of this, <code>ABS</code>/<code>MIN</code>/<code>MAX</code> bring further challenges because their source operands are scattered in different basic blocks due to their built-in if-then-else semantics. We found the MSVC auto-vectorizer may only narrow the type of the operand in one basic block making it inconsistent with operands in other basic blocks. Such inconsistency will cause the auto-vectorizer to fail matching the pattern and cancel vectorization.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> For example:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

        a[i] = b[i] &gt; 0 ? b[i] : -b[i]; 
}</code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Visual Studio 2022 17.5, there was no vectorization, and the code-generation was:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the 17.6 release, the code-generation has been improved into a single </span><code>abs v16.8h,v16.8h</code><i><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2 id="scalar-code-generation-improved-based-on-value-range-analysis">Scalar code-generation improved based on value range analysis</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When one register is compared with an immediate value, the compiler can deduce the value range of the register, and this information is useful for later optimizations, for example evaluating comparison results statically.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">MSVC already has an infrastructure for doing value range deduction, the backend just needs to teach the middle-end about the semantics of its supported comparison instructions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The ARM64 backend previously missed this support for <code>CBZ</code> and <code>CMP</code>. For </span><code>cbz reg, label</code><i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><code>reg</code> <span data-contrast="auto">must equal to zero in true path, and the same applies for <code>CBNZ</code> on false path. While for </span><code>cmp reg, #imm</code><i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><code>reg</code> <span data-contrast="auto">must equal</span> <code>imm</code> <span data-contrast="auto">in true path. Knowing such equivalence, the compiler could simplify code-generation. Let’s see a simple example:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">int cal(int a)

    else 
        return a * 2; 
}</code><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Visual Studio 2022 17.5, MSVC was generating the following instruction sequence:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

        ret 
|$LN2@cal| 
        lsl         w0,w0,#1 
        ret </code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><code>mov w0, #0</code> <span data-contrast="auto">is redundant because when the execution reaches there, </span><code>w0</code> <span data-contrast="auto">must be zero. After our recent optimization, the code-generation is optimal in release 17.6:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2 id="scalar-code-generation-improved-to-catch-more-if-conversion-opportunities">Scalar code-generation improved to catch more if-conversion opportunities</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You may have noticed there is another difference in the code-generation for the above test case. <code>CSELEQ</code> is used instead of branch. The ARM64 ISA supports the <code>CSEL</code> instruction to do if-conversion which saves both execution cycles and code size. Previously, MSVC couldn’t generate <code>CSEL</code> when the selected value came from a return statement. We fixed this in the 17.6 release, so for the above example <code>CSELEQ</code> is used instead of <code>CBNZ</code>. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In summary, for the if-return-else-return pattern, the ARM64 backend has been taught to generate a <code>CSEL</code> instruction if the return statement is in any of the following operations:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2 id="arm64-instruction-combiner-now-supports-instructions-with-multiple-definitions">ARM64 instruction combiner now supports instructions with multiple definitions</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a modern compiler, MSVC is carrying out various instruction combinations across compilation stages. While a bunch of combine rules have already been implemented, we recently found one interesting case was missing. Take the following case for example:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">int test(int a, int b) 
{ 
    if (a &lt; b) 
        return b - a; 
    else 
        return 7; 
} </code><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Visual Studio 2022 17.5, the code-generation was:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">|int test(int,int)| PROC 
        cmp         w0,w1 
        sub         w0,w1,w0 
        blt         |$LN3@test| 
        mov         w0,#7 
|$LN3@test| 
        ret </code></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><code>cmp w0, w1</code><span data-contrast="auto"> and the following </span><code>sub w0, w1, w0</code> <span data-contrast="auto">can be combined into a single <code>SUBS</code>. We missed it because the later stage combiner had glitches when supporting combining into instructions with multiple definitions. Now we have fixed this, so the code-generation in the 17.6 release has been improved into:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-default"><code class="language-default">|int test(int,int)| PROC 
        subs        w9,w1,w0 
        mov         w8,#7 
        cselgt      w0,w9,w8 
        ret </code><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></pre>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The code-generation is utilizing <code>SUBS</code> to set the conditional code and doing subtraction at the same period, it also benefited from the above mentioned if-conversion optimization on return statement, so <code>CSEL</code> is used instead of branch</span></p>
