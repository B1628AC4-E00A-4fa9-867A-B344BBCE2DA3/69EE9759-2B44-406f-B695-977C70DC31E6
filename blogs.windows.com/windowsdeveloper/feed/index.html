										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since launching the <a style="color: #0563c1;" href="https://aka.ms/NewStore">new Microsoft Store on Windows</a> last year, we’ve welcomed thousands of great desktop apps and games. We are excited to introduce the Microsoft Store App Awards and recognize select developers and apps. We're excited to introduce the Microsoft Store Community Choice Awards, which are nominated by the community, and the Microsoft Store Editor's Choice Awards, which are apps recognized by Microsoft. Although gaming is always incredibly important to us and our customers, for these awards, we're focused on apps.

We’re excited and humbled by the community participation for these awards. Thank you again for the great nominees, and for picking the apps which are the most important to you!

Finally, thanks to the developers of these apps! We love the diversity of technology used, and the teams who created them. <strong>From individual developers through to distributed projects, open source, and larger companies, you’ve shown that amazing, beautiful, and useful apps can come from development teams of any size and type.</strong>
<h2>Microsoft Store Editor’s Choice Awards</h2>
In addition to community choice voting, the Microsoft Store team selected the best apps for Creativity, Entertainment, Productivity, Social, and one for special recognition.  The Microsoft Store on Windows is home to many great apps and the store catalog continues to grow. Apps were evaluated and selected based on user experience, design excellence, app quality, and customer value. We’re proud to have all the apps we’re showcasing here today in the Microsoft Store on Windows.

Here are the apps we'd like to recognize:
<h2>Special Recognition</h2>
First, there’s one app we’d like to present for special recognition from the editors. The app is <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/talk-for-me/9WZDNCRDM04G">Talk for Me</a> and it was designed to “give those without a voice, a voice.”

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56550" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Talk-For-Me-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1618" />

We found this quote in the product description especially moving:
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"I have ALS [Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]. It took my voice and I have not been able to communicate with my loved ones. I bought an eye gaze device so could access my windows 8 tablet. I found Talk for Me. This app has everything that all the highly priced programs have. it is customizable and very easy to use. Customer service is top notch! I love it! I can finally speak to my family with Talk For Me!"</em></p>
We love that the app embraces a simple, but extremely usable design for the target audience, and that it is so critical to its users.
<h2>Entertainment - Video</h2>
Whether it is for yourself or your family,  Our catalog is filled with so many great TV shows and movies.

The winner of the Video Entertainment category is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/disney/9nxqxxlfst89">Disney+</a>!

The two finalists for entertainment are:

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/hulu/9WZDNCRFJ3L1?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">Hulu for Windows</a>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56534" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Hulu-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" />

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N1SV6841F0B">Tubi</a>

<h2>Entertainment – Audio and Music</h2>
We love listening to music and podcasts, and the apps which enable that help make our days that much more enjoyable.

Our winner in this category is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCBCSZSJRSB">Spotify</a>!

We’re pleased to share that the finalists, which both focus on podcasts, are:

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PM46JRSDQQR">FluentCast</a>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56531" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/FluentCast-Edited.png" alt="" width="1373" height="868" />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thankful and humbled by the response and feedback from the developer community since we <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">announced</a> the new Microsoft Store on Windows last year and our <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Open App Store principles</a> in February. Today, we would like to celebrate the developers that joined us on this journey and share new discoverability opportunities on Windows, the launch of Microsoft Store Ads to help developers reach the right customers at the right time, and new tools for Win32 and PWA developers.

Over the past year, Microsoft Store welcomed thousands of great apps like<strong> ACDSee Gemstone, Adobe Express, Audacity, Canva, Course Hero, Discord, Drawboard PDF, Epic Games, Firefox, Luminar Neo &amp; Luminar AI, Mailchimp, Meitu XiuXiu, Microsoft Teams, OpenOffice, Paramount+, PuTTY, WinZip, and Zoom.</strong> In the first quarter of 2022 alone, we saw more than a 50% increase in new desktop apps and games coming to Microsoft Store compared to the same period last year.

We have also been partnering with Amazon to give Android developers an easy path to bring their Appstore apps to Windows 11. Amazon has already brought thousands of apps and games to Microsoft Store on Windows 11 and will continue to grow the catalog monthly. The <strong>Amazon Appstore</strong> preview is currently available in the U.S., and it will expand to five additional countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, by the end of this year. Learn more <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/appstore-on-windows-11">here</a>.
<h3><strong>New discoverability opportunities on Windows</strong></h3>
Today, we are announcing further steps we are taking to help developers reach and retain new customers through the Microsoft Store:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Windows Search</strong>. When an app is listed in Microsoft Store, Windows Insiders will soon be able to open Start, type the name of an app, view search results from Microsoft Store, and easily install it from there without distracting from their flow. Start is a highly used surface in Windows, and over half of customers search from Start regularly. When customers search from Start, they often search for apps, so Windows Search is a valuable new channel for acquisition of Store apps.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56487" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Windows-Search-Install.png" alt="" width="3009" height="1940" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Restore Apps</strong>. As we noted <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/01/26/a-new-era-of-the-pc/">earlier this year</a>, the PC market saw the biggest growth in a decade. To make it easier for customers to transition to their new PCs quickly and seamlessly, we will soon test a new feature in the Windows Insider channel that helps customers automatically restore their apps, previously installed from the Microsoft Store, to their new Windows device. This will also help developers retain their customers without having to remind customers to re-download their app.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56485" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Restore-Apps.png" alt="" width="3432" height="1443" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pop-up store</strong>. The pop-up store and Microsoft Store badges allow developers to easily promote apps on any website, extending and simplifying the install experience. Find out more about how to create badges <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/app-badge">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Introducing Microsoft Store Ads</strong></h3>
We are also excited to introduce <strong>Microsoft Store Ads</strong>, a new product designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great, engaging content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to make music.

In the coming months, developers will be able to create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store using Microsoft Advertising. Only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.

We will soon kick off a pilot program to test and gather feedback; developers interested in participating can <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=launch&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_source=online">sign up on the waitlist</a>. We look forward to sharing more details in the future.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56482" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Ads-Developer-Experience.png" alt="" width="1872" height="766" />
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56481" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Ads-Consumer-Experience.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /></h3>
<h3><strong>Now open to all Win32 developers</strong></h3>
Last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we’re pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more).

We are also introducing new features designed in response to feedback from the program:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Automating Store Submissions</strong><strong>. </strong>Using the new GitHub Action or Rest APIs, developers will be able to automate and manage app submissions directly from their CI/CD build pipeline. Microsoft PowerToys is a great example. You can learn more <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/microsoft-store-publish">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56489" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Publish-GitHub-action53.png" alt="" width="800" height="867" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>App visibility</strong>. Developers can now make their Win32 apps undiscoverable to test them with a small group before going live.</li>
 	<li><strong>App telemetry</strong>. Developers will soon be able to access new analytic dashboards to get more insights about their Win32 apps, understand their user acquisition funnel, app usage, health metrics, and install success analytics.</li>
 	<li><strong>App reviews. </strong>Developers can now engage with and respond to reviews on Win32 apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New tools for PWA developers</strong></h3>
Over the past years, <a href="http://www.pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder.com</a> has been the best resource and tool to learn, get started, build, and package quality PWAs and distribute apps to Microsoft Store or other marketplaces.

In partnership with the developer community, we are releasing new capabilities:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>PWA Starter</strong>. This capability helps developers bootstrap their development of PWAs, aiding with performance, integration with the host Operating System, and guidelines for a great user experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>PWA Studio</strong>. This is a new <a href="https://aka.ms/install-pwa-studio">Visual Studio Code extension</a> to help build, package, and publish PWAs to Microsoft Store without leaving Visual Studio Code.</li>
 	<li><strong>Meta Quest support</strong>. PWAs in Microsoft Store are already supported on HoloLens devices, and Meta has recently announced support for PWAs on its VR devices. Microsoft and Meta partnered to make PWABuilder the ultimate tool for packaging PWAs for virtual and mixed reality, giving developers the ability to sideload packages for Meta Quest and HoloLens.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56484" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-PWA.png" alt="" width="2011" height="1249" />

We want to thank the developer community for the feedback we have received in the past year and look forward to continuing our partnership to make Microsoft Store on Windows better for all developers and customers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a team, we’re thrilled to spend time with the developer community at <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222022-05-24T00%253A00%253A00-07%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222022-05-26T23%253A59%253A00-07%253A00%2522%257D">Microsoft Build</a>.

Windows is a place where people come to create, to learn, and to connect. One of the most energizing aspects of Windows is how the developer community has been engaging with the platform, bringing value to over a billion people across the planet. Windows is the platform for the world’s innovation, and developers are central to unlocking the next wave of experiences that people will need today and in the future. This is what drives us as a team to innovate and empower developers with the tools to dream big and turn their ideas into reality.

Today, we are sharing new updates to Windows 11 and the Microsoft Store for developers, including:
<ul>
 	<li>New app building tools to enable you to take your existing code and make it incredibly compelling on Windows.</li>
 	<li>New ways to reach and engage customers through the Microsoft Store.</li>
 	<li>A new development kit with AI Capabilities – Project Volterra - and a comprehensive Arm-native developer toolchain.</li>
</ul>
We are building toward our vision for a world of intelligent hybrid compute, bringing together local compute on the CPU, GPU, and NPU and cloud compute with Azure.

In the future, moving compute workloads between client and cloud will be as dynamic and seamless as moving between Wi-Fi and cellular on your phone today.

Increasingly, magical experiences powered by AI will require enormous levels of processing power beyond the capabilities of traditional CPU and GPU alone. But new silicon like neural processing units (NPUs) will add expanded capacity for key AI workloads.

Bringing Azure and Windows closer together will enable you to bring new classes of applications to life for your commercial and consumer customers. This journey begins with Windows 365, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Azure Virtual Desktop and will continue with cloud and NPU processing on more Windows devices.

We will also continue to bridge toward this future, utilizing our open platform, open store, and open hardware ecosystem to empower you to bring your skills, talent, and passion forward.

<h3>New app building tools and Windows subsystem updates</h3>
Our goal with the open platform of Windows is to make it easy for you to build and run your apps on Windows, whether they’re .NET, web, Android, C++, Linux, or any number of cross-platform frameworks. This makes it easy to use Windows for all your developer workflows and distribution models and reach more users to build your business your way.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56500" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/New_App_Building_Tools_Logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

For building Windows desktop apps, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Windows App SDK</a> and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/">WinUI 3</a> platform make it easy to build rich native apps for Windows 11 using C# or C++ while still reaching users on Windows 10. The latest <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK/1.0.1">Windows App SDK 1.1</a> update is in preview and will be released soon, with new features like Fluent visual materials in WinUI 3, updated desktop windowing APIs, enhancements to push notifications, new environment variable APIs for C++, and various performance improvements.

To help with getting started using WinUI 3 to build your app, we’re also updating two tools:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs">Template Studio for WinUI (C#)</a>: this Visual Studio extension makes it easy to get started building a new C# WinUI 3 app. It provides project scaffolding for your app UI, logic, and packaging.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant">.NET Upgrade Assistant</a>: we’re working on an update to this open-source tool to help you automate migration of .NET UWP apps to .NET 6, including updating from WinUI 2 to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/">WinUI 3</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk-ovw">migration guide</a> with more information.</li>
</ul>
For cross-platform app development, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui">.NET Multi-platform App UI</a> (.NET MAUI) 1.0 was just released. .NET MAUI helps you build apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a shared codebase and is built on top of WinUI 3 when running on Windows.

To build great Windows apps using the web, you can create a <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fprogressive-web-apps-chromium%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=l5J%2Bo3wEOCX9LPvCFrYm9%2B2BRCXk1JVn8cgLDRmEqpY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Progressive Web App</a>, which enables you to distribute and install your site like an app and take advantage of richer OS capabilities. We’re constantly making PWAs more powerful on Windows and have most recently enabled <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fprogressive-web-apps-chromium%2Fwhats-new%2Fpwa&amp;data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2Bt4K4if0zslC%2BEk3CcgtbhWa2EjFDx%2B6zYqCbR3Lii4%3D&amp;reserved=0">new features</a> like URL protocol handler registration and window controls overlay for custom title bars.

You can also use <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.microsoft.com%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fwebview2%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=AnR7OKT3Yx2TzuO%2FgSUo%2Fr%2FNPxU8VC4jhX50k7wJQ%2FU%3D&amp;reserved=0">WebView2</a> to embed web content in your Windows apps using a shared evergreen runtime. WebView2’s shared runtime gives you access to the latest web platform features and security updates at the same time as the Microsoft Edge browser and enables great performance by minimizing disk footprint and runtime costs across apps. There are already thousands of apps taking advantage of WebView2 – including the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-chat-from-microsoft-teams-on-windows-11-for-your/ba-p/2809877">new Teams chat experience on Windows 11</a>, which leverages WebView2 and Fluent Design to create a great user experience. For more on the latest for web developers, see <a href="https://aka.ms/edgebuildblog2022">https://aka.ms/edgebuildblog2022</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) has become an integral tool for many developers, dev-ops engineers, and others with Linux workflows, especially for the cloud and web. To make it even easier to install and update WSL, we <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/">recently made it available in the Microsoft Store</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/android/wsa/">Windows Subsystem for Android™</a> (WSA) is being continually updated to improve compatibility, performance, and extensibility for Android apps running on Windows. This includes updating to Android Open Source Project 12.1.
<h3>New opportunities for app engagement</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56499" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Widgets_UPDATED.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" />

<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/stay-up-to-date-with-widgets-7ba79aaa-dac6-4687-b460-ad16a06be6e4">Widgets in Windows 11</a> provide a fresh, glanceable, and useful view into app content for users. We’re energized by the customer feedback on Widgets to date; people are enjoying the quick access to content most important to them seamlessly without breaking their flow. Beginning later this year you’ll be able to start building Widgets as companion experiences for your Win32 and PWA apps on Windows 11, powered by the <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/">Adaptive Cards</a> platform.

You can also leverage capabilities of touch, pen, voice, and AI, to create features that increase engagement and differentiate your apps with more natural interactions for your customers. Like the natural feel of a haptic pen or Azure text-to-speech capabilities to build transcription. To learn more about how our own apps, like OneNote, are doing this with their updated visual design, incorporating both the Windows 11 look and feel along with pen and voice functionalities, <a href="https://aka.ms/OneNoteRefresh">visit the OneNote Blog</a>.

We also shared an early vision for how apps that create and store content in the cloud could start to integrate that custom content into familiar user engagement surfaces in Windows 11 like File Explorer, and common file dialogs. This would enable Windows to show your app and app content to users in the right context, providing a seamless app installation and content discovery experience across devices. Stay tuned for more on this front.
<h3>New ways to reach and engage customers through the Microsoft Store</h3>
With Windows 11, we rebuilt the Microsoft Store from the ground up for developers: placing their success at its core and designing it to help you run your business with open policies. The Microsoft Store on Windows gives you the choice to use the commerce engine that we provide, with industry-leading revenue share, or your own commerce engine in your app, in which case you get to keep all the revenue.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56498" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Store.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" />

We’re pleased to share the following announcements for the Microsoft Store on Windows:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Microsoft Store is open to all:</strong> We have removed the waitlist program for Win32 applications in the Microsoft Store, opening it up to all app developers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Microsoft Store Ads:</strong> Based on feedback from the developer community, we’re soon piloting new developer tools to help reach the right customers at the right time. Using Microsoft Advertising, developers will be able to create, run and view ad campaigns in the Store, improving discoverability and conversion for apps.</li>
 	<li><strong>Amazon Appstore:</strong> The Amazon Appstore preview on Windows 11 is currently available in the US, and it will be expanding to five additional countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, by the end of this year.</li>
</ul>
The Microsoft Store on Windows is the best place for you to get in front of 1B+ Windows customers that are always looking for new experiences. To learn more about what’s new in the Microsoft Store, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56442">visit this blog post</a>.
<a name="OpenHardware"></a>
<h3>Open Hardware Ecosystem &amp; Project Volterra</h3>
We believe in an open hardware ecosystem for Windows giving you more flexibility and more options, and the ability to support a wide range of scenarios. As such, we are always evolving the platform to support new and emerging hardware platforms and technologies.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56497" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Project_Volterra.png" alt="" width="1900" height="845" />

As we look forward to what is next and how we can further innovate in this space, we are excited to announce Project Volterra, a new device powered by the Snapdragon compute platform. With Project Volterra* you will be able to explore many AI scenarios via the new Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK for Windows toolkit announced today by Qualcomm Technologies.

And because we expect to see NPUs being built into most, if not all, future computing devices, we’re going to make it easy for developers to leverage these new capabilities, by baking support for NPUs into the end-to-end Windows platform.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56495" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Arm-native_Toolchain_logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

To ensure ease of use for our shared customers, we are also announcing a comprehensive end-to-end Arm-native toolchain for Arm native apps, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Full Visual Studio 2022 &amp; VSCode</li>
 	<li>Visual C++</li>
 	<li>Modern .NET 6 and Java</li>
 	<li>Classic .NET Framework</li>
 	<li>Windows Terminal</li>
 	<li>WSL and WSA for running Linux and Android apps</li>
</ul>
You’ll see the first preview of many of these tools in the next few weeks, including VS 2022.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56501" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Open-source_Native_Arm_Logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

We’re also hard at work helping many open-source projects natively target Arm including Python, Node, git, LLVM, and more.
<h3>Hybrid Loop</h3>
AI is evolving at a rapid pace. We know that keeping up with the fast-paced evolution has been challenging. We are working on solving this problem for you.

We’ve built a powerful, cross-platform development pattern for building AI experiences that span the cloud and edge. This pattern allows you to make late binding runtime decisions on whether to run inferencing on Azure or the local client. It can also dynamically shift the load between client and cloud.

We are calling it <em>the hybrid loop</em>. And we are bringing this as a cross-platform capability through the ONNX Runtime and Azure ML, along with a Prototype AI toolchain to make heterogenous targeting easy.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56496" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Hybrid_Loop.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1060" />

And because Project Volterra contains a powerful Neural Processing Unit (NPU), it will be a great device upon which to explore the new Hybrid Loop pattern and the Prototype AI toolchain in Azure ML.

We will be sharing more details on Hybrid Loop and the AI Toolchain soon, so stay tuned.
<h3>Where we are today…and where we are going tomorrow</h3>
We hope you are as excited as we are about where we are today and where we are going tomorrow.

With new app building tools, you can take your existing code and make new and compelling app experiences while reaching your customers in new ways through Widgets and Microsoft Store Ads.

Our emerging model of hybrid compute and AI, along with NPU-enabled devices creates a new developer platform for you to build high ambition apps leveraging incredible amounts of power.

We want you to build cloud-native AI applications. With native Arm64 Visual Studio, .NET support, and Project Volterra coming later this year, we are releasing new tools to help you take the first step on this journey.

You can get started today by building on our cloud and taking advantage of our tooling and services. And it’s just the beginning of what will be possible. We can’t wait to see what you build.

<em>*</em> <em>Product features are subject to change and may vary by market when the product is released. Microsoft will share more details at a later date.</em>

Editor’s note, May 25, 2022: This blog post was updated for clarity in the open hardware ecosystem section.]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Order Independent Transparency</strong></h3>
Rendering transparent objects is complicated! The Babylon.js Platform has always strived to make it as easy as possible to help you inform the system of rendering order, alpha index, run depth-prepasses, and much more, so your scene can look correct. With Babylon.js 5.0 we’ve wrapped a bow on it all. All of the complexity of rendering transparent objects can now disappear with one single, simple line of code:

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our mission is to create one of the most powerful, simple, and aesthetically pleasing web rendering engines in the world. Fueled by our passion to make it completely open and free for everyone.

Today is an important milestone for the Babylon.js platform and we are thrilled to announce the launch of the next version of the Babylon.js platform, Babylon.js 5.0.

[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zELYw2qEUjI[/embed]

Babylon.js 5.0 is quite simply the biggest, boldest, and most ambitious update to the platform to date. From full support of WebGPU, to the ability to deploy experiences across platforms with Native Capabilities, to more tools, features, and improvements than you can count — Babylon.js 5.0 ushers in the next generation of web rendering technology for everyone.

Before diving into more detail, we want to take a quick moment to humbly thank the incredible community of developers, the 400+ contributors, and the steadfast advocates that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing platform. Babylon.js would not be here without you.
<h3><strong>WebGPU</strong></h3>
WebGPU represents the next evolution in browser to GPU communication. The W3C's "GPU for the Web" Community Group built it from the ground up with performance in mind. WebGPU offers web developers access to some of the most advanced modern graphics capabilities such as compute shaders and lightning-fast texture loading. We have been actively participating in the WebGPU working group from its earliest days and are proud to announce that Babylon.js 5.0 offers FULL support for WebGPU.

This means that with Babylon.js 5.0 you can develop mind-bending, rendering experiences on the web using both WebGL and WebGPU - you don’t have to learn a new graphics API, Babylon.js takes care of it for you!

As WebGPU becomes more broadly available in your favorite browsers later this year, and Babylon.js 5.0 is set up and ready for you to take advantage of this new performance rocket ship!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 16th the Windows App SDK team released version 1.0! It’s the starting point for your ability to build and ship Windows desktop apps with Windows 10 and Windows 11. It includes the ability to use Windows App SDK with a .NET 5+ app, as well as WinUI 3 and WebView2 for modern UI development. Windows App SDK 1.0 is one of many important improvements you can use to create great Windows apps and we can't wait to keep moving forward with even more features!
<h3><strong>What is the Windows App SDK?</strong></h3>
When building an app with Windows App SDK you have access to both modern Windows technologies and new features, while also having access to the power of Desktop Win32. These technologies are decoupled from the OS and ship through <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK/">NuGet</a> so they can be adopted incrementally across all 1 billion + Windows devices, without having to wait for users to update their OS. With WinAppSDK you are in control of upgrading to new Versions!

When building an app with Windows App SDK, you’ll start by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022">installing the developer tools</a>. This provides WinUI 3 project and item templates and sets up your app to reference the Windows App SDK package and any needed dependencies. Then you can create an app with a modern Windows 11 experience using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">WinUI 3</a>.
<h3><strong>What’s supported in Windows App SDK 1.0?</strong></h3>
Lots of features are available both new and continuing from previous versions!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-instanced apps only allow one instance of the app running at a time. WinUI apps are multi-instanced by default. They allow you to launch multiple instances of the same app at one time, which we call multiple instances. However, you may implement single-instancing based on the use case of your app. Attempting to launch a second instance of a single-instanced app will only result in the first instance’s main window being activated instead. This tutorial demonstrates how to implement single-instancing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this section, you will be able to: 1. Turn off XAML’s generated Program code 2. Define customized MAIN method for redirection 3. Test single-instancing via app deployment</span>
<h3><b>Turn off XAML’s generated Program code</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to check for redirection as early as possible, and before creating any windows. To do this, we must define the symbol “DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN” in the project build properties.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Double-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name in Solution Explorer:</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Define the <b>DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN</b> symbol below</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DrumPad:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x86'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x86'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|arm64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|arm64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;</pre>
<h3><b>Define a customized Program class with a Main method</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A customized Program.cs file is created instead of running the default Main method because it enables the app to check for redirection, which is not what WinUI apps default to doing.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to Solution Explorer -&gt; </span><b>Right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name -&gt; Add -&gt; New Item</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><b>Visual C# Items</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -&gt; Code -&gt; Class -&gt; Name it </span><b>Program.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -&gt; Add</span></li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your project should look like this:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56432" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture1.png-BLOG-3.png" alt="" width="832" height="828" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Add the following namespaces:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using System.Threading;
using Microsoft.UI.Dispatching;
using Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle;
using Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation;
using Windows.Storage;</pre>
4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace the empty class Program with following:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">class program
{
    [STAThread]
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        WinRT.ComWrappersSupport.InitializeComWrappers();
        bool isRedirect = await DecideRedirection();
        if (!isRedirect)
        {
            Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application.Start((p) =&gt;
            {
                var context = new DispatcherQueueSynchronizationContext(
                    DispatcherQueue.GetForCurrentThread());
                SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(context);
                new App();
            });
        }

        return 0;
    }</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Main determines if it should redirect or launch a new app instance via DecideRedirection();</span>

5. D<span style="font-weight: 400;">efine DecideRedirection() below the Main method:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private static async Task DecideRedirection()
{
    bool isRedirect = false;
    AppActivationArguments args = AppInstance.GetCurrent().GetActivatedEventArgs();
    ExtendedActivationKind kind = args.Kind;
    AppInstance keyInstance = AppInstance.FindOrRegisterForKey("randomKey");
    
    if (keyInstance.IsCurrent) {
        keyInstance.Activated += OnActivated;
    }
    else {
        isRedirect = true;
        await keyInstance.RedirectActivationToAsync(args);
    }
    return isRedirect;
}
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: DecideRedirection determines if the app has been registered by registering a key that represents your app instance. Based on the result of key registration, it infers if there is a current app instancing running; therefore, whether or not to redirect or allow the app to launch for the first time</span>

6. D<span style="font-weight: 400;">efine the helper method OnActivated(), below the DecideRedirection method:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private static void OnActivated(object sender, AppActivationArguments args)
{
    ExtendedActivationKind kind = args.Kind;
}</pre>
<h3><b>Testing single-instancing via app deployment</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, we have been testing our app by running the solution debugger. We can only have one debugger running at once. Therefore, it prevents us from knowing whether the app is single-instanced because we can’t debug the same project solution twice at the same time. To test, we will deploy the application. After deploying, we can launch the app from the desktop like how you would with Microsoft Word.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to Solution Explorer -&gt; </span><b>Right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name -&gt; </span><b>Deploy</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the start menu and click on the search field</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type “DrumPad” (or your app’s name) in the search field</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on the app icon from the search result to launch the app</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat steps 2 to 4 to launch the same app again and see if another instance pops up</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Result</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56433" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture2.gif-BLOG-3.gif" alt="" width="1388" height="1080" />
<h3><b>Wrapping up</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56420&amp;preview=true"><b>In part 1</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we learned how to use WinUI 3 controls to create the app’s visual layer.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56426&amp;preview=true"><b>In part 2</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we introduced the concepts of dark mode and windowing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>In part 3</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we enforced single-instancing for our app.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the code we have covered from the blog series is on </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with branches for the different steps. The main branch is the most comprehensive. The other branches are intended to show you how the app architecture evolved.</span>
<h3><b>Further learning</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some links to check out with resources on building for WinUI 3 apps with WinAppSDK. </span><b>Don’t stop learning!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More examples:</span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><b>Adding event handlers: Sounds, Dark Mode &amp; Windowing (Part 2)</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56420&amp;preview=true">part 1</a> of the WinAppSDK Blog Series you implemented the visual layer of the DrumPad using WinUI 3 controls. However, if you click on any buttons, nothing happens, because we have not defined any actions, which we will do now. You will be guided to accomplish the following in this post: </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play a sound when a drum pad button is clicked </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch into dark mode when the toggle switch is turned on </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go into a specific windowing mode when a presenter mode is selected</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Play a sound when a drum pad button is clicked</b></h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download sound clips to your project’s Assets folder</span></li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You may download any .wav sound clips for this part. Optionally, you could use my sound clips </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/tree/5c6e560edf74ceb0a40183e20b66741175a046d7/DrumPad/DrumPad/Assets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. Store the sound clips under your project’s Assets folder because that is the folder path we will provide to specify which sound to play.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Install the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">System.Windows.Extensions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NuGet Package</span>

<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Playing a sound in WinUI apps requires using a library called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">System.Media</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, accessible through a NuGet Package. Following these two steps to install the NuGet Package in Visual Studio:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to </span><b>Solution Explorer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, under Dependencies, </span><b>right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Packages, select Manage NuGet Packages</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the </span><b>Browse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab, search </span><b>System.Windows.Extensions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>install</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Add the following namespace to </span><b>MainAppWindow.xaml.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using System.Media;
</pre>
4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a call-back function that plays a sound in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainAppWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void pad_clicked(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // get the full path to your app’s folder where it is installed
    var installedPath = Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.Path;
    // join path above with the sub-paths in your Assets folder and the specific sound file
    var soundFile = Path.Join(installedPath, "Assets", "rim.wav");

    SoundPlayer player = new System.Media.SoundPlayer(soundFile);
    player.Play();
}</pre>
5. l<span style="font-weight: 400;">ink the call-back function above to a button via the </span><b>Click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" … … Click="pad_clicked" /&gt;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat step 4 and 5 to attach another sound clip to a different button until all the buttons have a click action! For your reference, check out my </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/blob/App_Logic/DrumPad/DrumPad/MainWindow.xaml.cs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/blob/App_Logic/DrumPad/DrumPad/MainWindow.xaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on GitHub.</span>
<h3><b>Implement dark mode</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark mode is an app appearance where the content is laid out on a dark background. It gives the app a different aesthetic look and can improve readability, especially in a low-light environment.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define SolidColorBrush under the light and dark themes below the comment &lt;!– Other app resources here –&gt;:</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">App.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Key="Light"&gt;
        &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="HomePageBackgroundBrush" Color="Transparent"/&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Key="Dark"&gt;
        &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="HomePageBackgroundBrush" Color="Black"/&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
&lt;/ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Indicate which theme to use via the </span><b>Background</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter (here we specified it on the outermost Grid in MainWindow.xaml):</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Grid Background="{ThemeResource HomePageBackgroundBrush}"&gt;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Define the action for ToggleSwitch in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWinow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void ToggleSwitch_Toggled(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ToggleSwitch toggleSwitch = sender as ToggleSwitch;
    if (toggleSwitch.IsOn) {
        ((FrameworkElement)this.Content).RequestedTheme = ElementTheme.Dark;
    }
    else {
        ((FrameworkElement)this.Content).RequestedTheme = ElementTheme.Light;
    }
}</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    4. Link the call-back function above to the ToggleSwitch control:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;ToggleSwitch … … Toggled="ToggleSwitch_Toggled" /&gt;
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You can save the state of the theme resource and persist the option the user chose at the next time of app startup with four easy steps. Follow </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/test-MDfiles/blob/main/DarkModeExtra.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement this functionality.</span>
<h3><b>Managing window display</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Windowing features in WinAppSDK provides a lot of flexibility and customization to your app experience. One of these customization features is the ability to change the Presenter mode of your window. There are 3 presenters you can use: Compact Overlay, Fullscreen, and Overlapped mode, with overlapped being the default presenter.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the following namespaces:</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using WinRT;
// Needed for WindowId
using Microsoft.UI;
// Needed for AppWindow
using Microsoft.UI.Windowing;
// Needed for XAML hwnd interop
using WinRT.Interop;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Declare the following variable in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">AppWindow m_appWindow;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Define a helper method </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow()</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private AppWindow GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow()
{
    IntPtr hWnd = WinRT.Interop.WindowNative.GetWindowHandle(this);
    WindowId myWndId = Microsoft.UI.Win32Interop.GetWindowIdFromWindow(hWnd);
    return AppWindow.GetFromWindowId(myWndId);
}</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The preceding code gets the window Id for the hwnd and then uses that window Id to get the current AppWindow. This will create the WinAppSDK window layer that gives you access to all the window customization features of the app window.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    4. Call GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow in the </span><b>MainWindow() method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">m_appWindow = GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow();
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    5. Set the current app window to the Compact Overlay presenter via the SetPresenter method in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    m_appWindow.SetPresenter(AppWindowPresenterKind.CompactOverlay);
}</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    6. Modify the MenuFlyouItem control to add the SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay function using the </span><b>Click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;MenuFlyoutItem Text="Compact Overlay" Click="SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay"/&gt;
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Repeat the steps 5 and 6 to implement the FullScreen and Overlapped (the default) presenters. The only change needed is to modify step 5 to use AppWindowPresenterKind.Overlapped or AppWindowPresenterKind.FullScreen.</span>
<h3><b>Result</b></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, you can see how we can leverage the amazing Windowing features to customize windowing options for your app. If you run your app again and click the drop-down button and choose Compact Overlay, the app window will not allow other app windows to overlap on top of it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows App SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WinUI 3 provides a modernized UI framework for building Windows 10 and Windows 11. This 3-part blog aims to help members new to Windows development quickly build familiarity using the Window App SDK through a fun sample app.</span>

<b>This post is only part 1 of the 3-part Windows App SDK blog</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is scoped to showing you how to use WinUI 3 controls to create a simple working user interface. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56426&amp;preview=true">2</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/01/28/making-the-app-single-instanced-part-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are for windowing and single instancing.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56417" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture2.png-BLOG-1.png" alt="" width="1872" height="1192" /></h3>
<h3><b>Sample app overview</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are going to build an app with buttons that produce drum sounds (DrumPad). As simple as this demo app is, it shows some cool things you can do right away with the Windows App SDK (WinAppSDK): </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Working with simple and easy-to-use UI controls from </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3</span></a></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizing </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/windowing/windowing-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windowing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options so that the user can multitask with the app always on top or have a full immersive experience </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the app </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/applifecycle/applifecycle-instancing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-instanced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce synchronization issues between instances</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Prerequisites</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install tools for developing apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11 </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">Create a WinUI 3 app</a> using the Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop) template, and name it <b>DrumPad</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Project template structure</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the WinUI 3 project template, most of our code will live in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs</span></i>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MainWindow.xaml</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a XAML file where we will define all of our UI elements, called “controls”, that will make up the visual layer of our application.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MainWindow.xaml.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the C# code-behind file where we will put all the logic that lets us interact with our application.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>UI layout design</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following WinUI 3 controls are used to represent components of a drum pad: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.dropdownbutton?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DropDownButton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: includes a chevron to indicate a menu can be opened </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.toggleswitch?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ToggleSwitch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a switch that can be toggled between dark/light mode </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.button?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: has a click user interaction and will trigger a unique drum sound </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.grid?view=winui-3.0">Grid</a>: made of rows and columns and is used to position the other controls</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56416" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture1.png-blog-1.png" alt="" width="1872" height="1300" />
<h3><b>Deleting partial template code</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The default project template comes with some blocks of code you’ll want to delete so we can replace them with our own markup and implementation:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span><!-- Delete the following template code -->
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;!-- Delete the following template code --&gt;

&lt;StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center"&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="myButton" Click="myButton_Click"&gt;Click Me&lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">// Delete the following template code

private void myButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    myButton.Content = "Clicked";
}
</pre>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Defining the layout</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your MainWindow.xaml we will start by defining the set of nested grids and specify their controls and positioning. Open MainWindow.xaml in the XML editor view and inside the </span><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> element add this content:</span><!-- Add GRID CODE --> <!-- STEP 1: Add DropDownButton & ToggleSwitch CODE --> <!-- STEP 3: Define column & row positioning --> <!-- STEP 4: Add Styling for BUTTON --> <!-- STEP 2: Add BUTTON CODE --></p>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;!-- Add GRID CODE --&gt;

&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto"/&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height="*"/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;

    &lt;Grid Margin="12"&gt;
        &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" /&gt;
        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;!-- STEP 1: Add DropDownButton &amp; ToggleSwitch CODE --&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
    
    &lt;Grid x:Name="Control1" Grid.Row="1" ColumnSpacing="30" RowSpacing="12"
          VerticalAlignment="Center" HorizontalAlignment="Center"&gt;
        &lt;!-- STEP 3: Define column &amp; row positioning --&gt;
        &lt;!-- STEP 4: Add Styling for BUTTON --&gt;
        &lt;!-- STEP 2: Add BUTTON CODE --&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Auto and * are used to specify the height and width above to create a responsive layout. The controls held within the Grids are not fixed in size and can adjust to fill in spaces as the user resizes the app window.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Setting up remaining controls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 1: Add DropDownButton &amp; ToggleSwitch:</span></p>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;DropDownButton Content="Display" Grid.Column="0" VerticalAlignment="Center" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Width="118" &gt;
    &lt;DropDownButton.Flyout&gt;
        &lt;MenuFlyout Placement="Bottom"&gt;
            &lt;MenuFlyoutItem Text="Default"/&gt;
            &lt;MenuFlyoutItem Text="Compact Overlay"/&gt;
            &lt;MenuFlyoutItem Text="Fullscreen"/&gt;
        &lt;/MenuFlyout&gt;
    &lt;/DropDownButton.Flyout&gt;
&lt;/DropDownButton&gt;

&lt;ToggleSwitch AutomationProperties.Name="simple ToggleSwitch" x:Name="dark_switch" Grid.Column="1" CornerRadius="3" VerticalAlignment="Center"  HorizontalAlignment="Right" MinWidth="0" HorizontalContentAlignment="Center" VerticalContentAlignment="Center" /&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 2: Add Buttons:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Button Background="#FF0000" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Content="Kick 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#C4425A" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1" Content="Kick 2"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#D41DD8" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="2" Content="Kick 3"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#6A21A3" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="3" Content="Kick 4"/&gt;

&lt;Button Background="#C4425A" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="0" Content="Clap 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#D41DD8" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1" Content="Clap 2"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#6A21A3" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" Content="Clap 3"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#473DB8" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="3" Content="Clap 4"/&gt;

&lt;Button Background="#D41DD8" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="0" Content="Open Hat 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#6A21A3" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="1" Content="Open Hat 2"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#473DB8" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="2" Content="Open Hat 3"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#26AAC7" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="3" Content="Open Hat 4"/&gt;

&lt;Button Background="#6A21A3" Grid.Row="3" Grid.Column="0" Content="Snare 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#473DB8" Grid.Row="3" Grid.Column="1" Content="Snare 2"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#26AAC7" Grid.Row="3" Grid.Column="2" Content="Snare 3"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#1A7BD6" Grid.Row="3" Grid.Column="3" Content="Snare 4"/&gt;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 3: Specify how the Grid should position these Buttons:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
    &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
    &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
    &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
&lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;

&lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;RowDefinition Height="*" /&gt;
    &lt;RowDefinition Height="*" /&gt;
    &lt;RowDefinition Height="*" /&gt;
    &lt;RowDefinition Height="*" /&gt;
&lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 4: Apply standardized styling to all the Buttons:</span>
<h3><b>Result</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as that, we should have a working visual layer built out using WinUI 3 controls. Choose x64 as your target platform, then press F5 to run the project solution. You should see:</span>

<h3><b>Moving forward</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The buttons don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anything yet, but that’s next time! In </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56426&amp;preview=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we will dive into implementing the business logic.</span>]]></content:encoded>
