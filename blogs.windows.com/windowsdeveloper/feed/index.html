										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your feedback matters – each week, we get thousands of feedback submissions that we triage, categorize and prioritize. We love the enthusiasm our customers and developers show daily for the Store and all its apps and games – and as product makers, we take that energy forward every day into our craft. Our ultimate goal is to build the best product for <em>you</em>.

Today, we’re excited to recap some important quality updates to the Microsoft Store on Windows that we’ve rolled out over the last few months.
<h3>Upping the ante on performance</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-57179 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/performance-1024x683.png" alt="Decorative image of anthropomorphic Store logo running" width="1024" height="683" />

We have some meaningful improvements to share from our recent work on performance. Overall Store launch time has been reduced by 25%, and we've reduced the number of download hanging issues by 50%<sup>1</sup>. To make sure you see the latest improvements, ensure you have the latest Windows update. We are continually striving for improvements in this space because we know how influential it is to your Store experience.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57180 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/New-download-indicator-1024x576.png" alt="Install button showing progress bar, percentage and number of MB downloaded from the total" width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>New download and install progress indicator</strong> – We’ve rebuilt the way we’re communicating download and install progress to you when you’re getting content from a Product Page. This is especially important when you’re downloading larger apps. You also can cancel an operation right from a Product Page if you’ve accidentally clicked download.
<h3>Improved browse and Product Page experiences</h3>
We’ve revamped a few places where we know customers go to find and acquire content.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57182 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/App-categories-1024x683.png" alt="A row of buttons on the gaming page are highlighted " width="1024" height="683" /><strong>Apps and games categories </strong>– We’ve introduced new categorizations of apps and games to help you narrow down what you’re looking for. From the Gaming page, you can now navigate easily and quickly through different game categories such as strategy, role-playing, puzzle and simulation. For Apps, we are experimenting with different categories so please keep an eye out for the experience and give us feedback!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57181 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/New-PDP-1024x576.png" alt="Product Page interface with large product screenshots and text overlaying trailer background " width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>Immersive Product Pages </strong>– We’re introducing a new feature for Product Pages that adds an immersive experience to the top of the page. For apps and games that provide a trailer, you’ll be able to enjoy it as you navigate to their various pages. Meanwhile, products without trailers will use beautiful hero images provided by the developers. There’s also an option in the Store settings page to toggle video autoplay on or off.
<h3>New Library, Updates and downloads pages</h3>
We know this one’s a crowd favorite – we’ve introduced two new pages, Library, and Updates and downloads, to help you find and manage all your content.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57183 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Library-1024x683.png" alt="Search button on top right corner of Library page highlighted" width="1024" height="683" />

<strong>Redesigned Library page</strong> – We made two big changes here. First, we changed the default filters to show all the products you own, not just products that are installed (you can still toggle this filter if you wish). Second, we’ve added a search bar that will help you find the name or the publisher of products you’re looking for.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57184 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Downloads-1024x576.png" alt="Downloads page showing an app with developer notes in progress of updating" width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>New Updates and downloads page</strong> – We are also moving the list of updates and downloads from the top section of the Library to its own dedicated page. This new page displays your list of active downloads or pending updates, and it shows the list of recent installs or updates. Version notes will also be displayed for a pending update or active download.
<h3>But wait…there’s more!</h3>
There’s a long list of other improvements we’ve quietly rolled out, such as Win32 apps support for our Store Web Installer on web, design updates, search recommendations, and easier ways to update Win32 apps from the Downloads and Product pages (this last feature is accessible via Windows Insiders starting Dec. 4). Lastly, our catalog continues to grow – we recently welcomed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NT1R1C2HH7J">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p0kn9s5rp86">Fantastical</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPDM5VSMTKQLBJ">Battle.net</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP9CKPHR0JP7F7">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFMDW72VHTTX9">Arc</a> and more!  We also recently announced our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/11/01/announcing-the-microsoft-store-awards-2024-winners/">2024 Store Awards</a>, and encourage you to check out the winning apps and games to find new AI experiences, gaming content, productivity tools and more!

We hope these improvements spark a bit more joy as you’re using the Store on Windows. Please submit your product feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Microsoft Store. And we are always publishing new updates, so leverage the “What’s New” page to keep track of the latest.

We have a lot more fun in store for you in 2025 – stay tuned!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[October was an exciting month of amazing showcases and announcements for applications leveraging the power of the NPU on the new Copilot+ PCs to deploy their AI innovations on Windows. Windows’ diverse hardware ecosystem empowers developers with a range of options at their fingertips to develop and deploy AI. From client to web apps, DirectML, foundational to <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/">Windows Copilot Runtime</a>, aims to uniquely simplify how developers can scale their AI innovations across Windows. Through a single, cross-hardware DirectX API, DirectML works across different hardware architectures, local device accelerators and machine learning frameworks, supporting an open platform for AI on Windows.

Let’s see some of the amazing AI innovations leveraging DirectML on Copilot+ PC NPUs.
<h2>Adobe® Premiere® Pro is the first Adobe app to leverage NPU on Copilot+ PCs, powered by Intel® Core™ Ultra and DirectML</h2>
Adobe is at the forefront of machine learning (ML) for creatives by providing a variety of hardware-accelerated features throughout their product suite. Now, Adobe Premiere Pro has enabled the machine learning efficiency of the latest Intel Core Ultra processors, opening up even more platform possibilities for Adobe customers.

Through collaboration with Intel and Microsoft, Adobe enabled Audio Category Tagger to optionally utilize Intel’s latest generation NPU using DirectML as a beta capability in Premiere Pro. This feature automatically tags audio, classifying clips as sound effects, music, dialog or ambience, which makes it easy for creatives to just get started editing their audio files right away. Each clip is marked with an Essential Sound Badge, and clicking on that badge opens the Essential Sound Panel to give access to parameters needed for that sound category.

[caption id="attachment_57164" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57164 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Adobe-Premier-Pro-Audio-Category-Tagger-1024x331.png" alt="A screen capture of Premier Pro showing audio clips marked by icons indicating audio categories A, B, C, and D. A is Music, B is SFX, C is Dialogue, and D is Ambience." width="1024" height="331" /> Audio Category Tagger labeling A. Music B. SFX C. Dialogue D. Ambience[/caption]

We are excited to partner with an AI innovator like Adobe to deliver on the promise of DirectML. Adobe’s extensive portfolio of applications and AI-driven scenarios offers a unique proving ground for DirectML and we’ll continue our partnership across GPU- and NPU-accelerated applications.
<h2>Capture One to bring NPU-enhanced Match Look and AI Crop features to Copilot+ PCs</h2>
<strong>Capture One</strong> is an imaging software commercial studio photographers use in the fashion and e-commerce industries. It helps professionals quickly edit many images while maintaining complete control over the creative expression and artistry behind every shot. At Snapdragon Summit, Capture One showcased two advanced AI-powered features on Copilot+ PCs powered by the Qualcomm NPU.

[caption id="attachment_57165" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57165 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Capture-One-Match-Look-1024x575.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Capture One application, where the Match Look feature is being applied to an image of a woman holding pears to her ears." width="1024" height="575" /> The Match Look feature being applied to an image in Capture One[/caption]

<strong>Match Look</strong> is a brand new tool that lets you instantly match the style or edits of a reference image — whether from a previous project, a film still or a mood board. It uses AI selection to dynamically adjust multiple editing sliders, giving you a strong starting point for editing and color grading.

[caption id="attachment_57167" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57167 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Capture-One-Ai-Crop-1024x575.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Capture One application where there is a crop reference set on an image of a purse in order to use the AI Crop feature. AI Crop is displayed on the right hand side of the screenshot where it's consistently applying the crop to other images." width="1024" height="575" /> The AI Crop feature in use in Capture One[/caption]

<strong>AI Crop </strong>allows you to make instant and consistent crops. Avoid errors and reduce manual effort. Set a crop reference on a single photo and automatically create consistent crops for all other images, even while shooting.

Capture One continues to utilize AI innovation in a way that maintains the creative artistry their photographers required and DirectML is excited to partner with them to bring their vision to life.
<h2>Affinity Photo 2 accelerates Object and Subject Selection capabilities with NPU</h2>
Affinity Photo 2 is a popular image-editing app that is used by millions of digital creators worldwide. Human creativity is the heart of Affinity products, so it’s no surprise that the first AI enhanced tools they announced are focused on optimizing artist workflows — eliminating tedious tasks and friction between creator and canvas. Affinity Photo 2 will scale these features to their creator base by using DirectML on Copilot+ PCs. Like stated during the Snapdragon Summit, they have already achieved the optimized workflow of these AI experiences with DirectML, powered by the Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU in the Snapdragon<sup>®</sup> X Elite Compute Platform.

<strong>Object Selection</strong> is a newly announced feature that eliminates the grunt work of manually creating layer masks, by using ML to quickly isolate and segment objects within an image. Automating this process gives artists a shortcut to the ‘real’ creative work — applying visual adjustments and effects to targeted areas within an image. Using the Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU in the Snapdragon<sup>®</sup> X Elite Compute Platform, Object Selection tasks will increase overall efficiency and productivity for creators.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Client apps are often the first interaction users have with your services, whether those are cloud native intelligent apps, web-hosted backends or business data. They set the tone for user experience and can offer personalized interactions right from the start. With over 1.5 billion Windows devices worldwide, you have an opportunity to build beautiful, responsive and engaging user experiences that target these devices.

Regardless of whether you are a web developer or a native app developer, you likely want to reach the most client devices possible with great user experiences in the most efficient way possible. Developing great client apps helps you connect with users, scale your services and keep users coming back. To help you achieve these goals, Microsoft invests in a wide variety of client application frameworks and technologies for developers to build custom client experiences.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57152 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/clientinvestments1920-1024x517.png" alt="Chart showing Microsoft investments in client development" width="1024" height="517" />Microsoft is actively investing across all these areas for client development, which includes multiple technologies for building Windows native, Cross-platform, Hybrid and Web client apps. This post outlines the native client application frameworks for Windows that we are investing in and features some of the incredible work we’ve been doing in those areas.
<h1>WinUI</h1>
WinUI, along with the two WinUI-based cross platform frameworks React Native for Desktop and .NET MAUI, are the three technologies we recommend for developing new applications that truly align with the Windows native experience.

WinUI enables developers to create fast and polished apps with the same rich set of modern UI controls and styles that powers key experiences in Windows. Its powerful toolkit has been refined in the most recent Windows App SDK 1.6 release, offering developers new performance improvements and control updates.

In WinAppSDK 1.6, WinUI adds Native Ahead-of-Time compilation support, one of the major new features in .NET development that results in apps with significantly reduced startup times and memory footprints.

[caption id="attachment_57148" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-57148 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Native-AOT-GIF-800-wide-1-loop.gif" alt="GIF of Bloom screensaver moving" width="800" height="291" /> Side-by-side comparison of Contoso Camera app launching with and without Native AOT[/caption]

In addition, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.tabview?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">TabView</a> control now features a new tab tear-out mode that lets users drag tabs out of a WinUI app just like they do in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, creating a new window and enabling snapping or maximizing in one smooth motion as they drag. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.pipspager?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">PipsPager</a> control also received a new wrapping mode, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.ratingcontrol?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">RatingControl</a> is now more customizable through theme resources.

[caption id="attachment_57153" align="aligncenter" width="1008"]<img class="wp-image-57153 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Picture4.png" alt="The WinUI 3 Gallery app showcased in dark mode" width="1008" height="690" /> The WinUI 3 Gallery app showcased in dark mode[/caption]

As a sneak peek for what’s coming to WinUI in the upcoming Windows App SDK 1.7-experimental1 release, developers can look forward to the reintroduction of the highly anticipated TitleBar control with a fresh set of community-driven feedback improvements, as well as windowing enhancements and convenience APIs for controlling window size, remembering position and more.
<h1>React Native for Desktop</h1>
React Native lets you use your React and JavaScript skills and tools to create native applications that target iOS, Android, Windows (via WinAppSDK and WinUI), macOS, TVs and more. Over the last several years, Meta has been working towards enabling the “<a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here">new architecture</a>” which includes new capabilities such as synchronous layout and effects, the concurrent renderer and better JS to native interfacing. At Microsoft, we’ve partnered with Meta to bring the new architecture to Windows and macOS.

In <a href="https://aka.ms/reactnative">React Native for Desktop version 0.76</a> (Fall 2024), new apps can optionally <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-new-arch">opt into the new architecture</a> preview when creating new apps from the CLI. On Windows, the new architecture unlocks new capabilities like deep integration with the Windows App SDK (including the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/composition">Scene Graph</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/overview">Windows Copilot Library</a>), as well as support for Win32-based applications. v0.76 also provides a template for library authors to write modules that simultaneously target both the old and new architectures.

Although the new architecture <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-roadmap">is still in preview</a>, several of our key apps are validating the updated React Native for Desktop platform and are beginning to flight experiences on top of the new architecture. If you’re interested in seeing the capabilities of React Native for Desktop, <a href="https://Aka.ms/reactnativegalleryapp">you can download the React Native Gallery from the Microsoft Store</a>.

[caption id="attachment_57154" align="aligncenter" width="975"]<img class="wp-image-57154 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Picture5.png" alt="React Native Gallery app" width="975" height="548" /> The React Native Gallery app includes samples of React Native components and modules that you can use in React Native for Windows apps.[/caption]

<h2><strong>Hyphen based ligature support in WPF</strong></h2>
Based on valuable feedback from the WPF community (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/109">Issue#109</a>), we’ve addressed a longstanding issue with hyphen-based ligatures not working in WPF. This improvement is aimed at enhancing the developer experience by ensuring better text rendering and more polished typography in WPF applications.

<h1>WinForms (Windows Forms)</h1>
Windows Forms has long been a favorite technology for lightweight desktop applications built on Win32 APIs, particularly within the enterprise Line of Business space. Beloved for the ease of use, now the latest updates to WinForms allow developers to start leveraging modern technology in their existing applications. Over the course of .NET 9, WinForms has modernized thousands of lines of code to leverage modern C# capabilities. In response to operating system enhancements WinForms has added multi-select support for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.folderbrowserdialog?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">FolderBrowserDialog</a>, click-through capabilities to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.toolstrip?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">ToolStrip</a> control, and more than 100 new and updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">System.Drawing</a> APIs to leverage more GDI+ capabilities than before. In response to overwhelming demand, WinForms also added a Dark Mode detection feature (in experimental mode)!

For the first time, with .NET 9, developers are able to quickly and easily leverage the async capabilities of Windows and .NET. In this release, WinForms has introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.invokeasync?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">Control.InvokeAsync</a>. This new API allows WinForms applications to more easily leverage Web APIs, Semantic Kernel, AI and more! These enhancements ensure that WinForms remains a powerful and versatile tool for modern desktop application development, bridging the gap between legacy systems and the cutting-edge technology of today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Passkeys on Windows just got easier! As part of Microsoft’s vision for a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/04/how-microsoft-can-help-you-go-passwordless-this-world-password-day/">passwordless future</a> we are working to make passkeys on Windows simple and intuitive. Passkeys are safer and easier to use than passwords, which are vulnerable to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">phishing and data breaches</a>. That is why, in support of a passwordless future, we partnered in the FIDO alliance with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">other platforms</a> in supporting passkeys. As part of our cross-industry commitment, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/26/new-security-features-in-windows-11-protect-users-and-empower-it/">launched</a> new native support for cross-device authentication and an updated experience to help users along the journey from website to platform. Continuing that journey at Authenticate 2024 we are introducing the following, which will be available in our Windows Insider channels in the coming months:
<ol>
 	<li>A plug-in model for third-party passkey providers</li>
 	<li>Enhanced native UX for passkeys</li>
 	<li>A Microsoft synced passkey provider</li>
</ol>
First, we’re excited to announce API support for third-party passkey providers to plug into the Windows 11 platform! Microsoft is partnering closely with 1Password, Bitwarden and others on integrating this capability to provide users with seamless third-party passkey provider integration into Windows 11. You will be able to use the same passkey on Windows 11 that you’ve created on your mobile device, and together we can raise the bar on login security with passkeys. To learn more join us at the Windows Security sessions at Authenticate Oct. 14-16!

Next, when creating and using passkeys, Windows 11 now has a redesigned Windows Hello experience. As a user, you can navigate to a website that supports passkeys and get prompted to select how you want to save your passkeys.

<em>Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a pop-up prompting the user to choose how to save their passkeys, protected with Windows Hello, with ‘Save to your Microsoft account’ and ‘Save another way’ as options.</em>

You will be asked to complete a one-time setup with your Microsoft account, and you will be prompted to save a recovery key that will be used to verify your identity and protect your passkeys through end-to-end encryption. You can then seamlessly authenticate using your preferred sign-in method (facial recognition, fingerprint or PIN), and save your passkey with Windows Hello.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57116 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/10/Windows-Authenticate-Blog-WH-face-ID.png" alt="Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a Windows Security pop-up and Windows Hello searching for Face ID to authenticate and save the passkey." width="624" height="435" />

Once you have created a new passkey you can choose to save it with Windows Hello and sync it so that you can also use it on another Windows device! Just login to another Windows 11 device with your Microsoft account, complete a one-time setup, and use your synced passkeys across your Windows 11 PCs. You get a simple, seamless, login experience—all you need to do is authenticate with Windows Hello. Your passkeys are secured by end-to-end encryption and protected with the device’s TPM (Trusted Platform Module).

Microsoft is committed to making passkeys more readily available wherever you need them, with the experience, flexibility and durability that you expect when using Windows. We are excited to have you try out these new features soon!

Join us as we continue paving the way towards a passwordless future with Windows 11.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">We are proud to announce that version 1.6 of the Windows App SDK is now available! Whether you’re looking for the incredible performance boost and footprint reduction of Native AOT support, enhancements for deploying your package, or quality of life improvements for controls like PipsPager and RatingControl, WinAppSDK 1.6 offers a raft of new features, performance boosts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and structural changes that enable you to make your native Windows apps better than ever before.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The Windows App SDK provides </span><span data-contrast="auto">a rich set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful and fast Windows desktop apps, including any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app. You can harness the modern controls and polish of WinUI 3, which ships as part of the WinAppSDK, or if you have an existing app that uses Win32 such as WPF, you can take advantage of only the parts of the SDK that you need. The WinAppSDK also stays up to date with frequent and OS-independent releases so your app can always access the latest innovations.</span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Get started with the Windows App SDK</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Check out the Windows App SDK </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span data-contrast="none">overview</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> page to learn more about it and see how to get started. Then, if you’re ready to dive into Visual Studio and begin with your first WinUI 3 app, see our </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10"><span data-contrast="none">setup instructions</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to start developing Windows apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">New features and improvements</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT support</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">With 1.6, the Windows App SDK now supports native Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation! When publishing your app as a Native AOT app, you produce an app which has been compiled ahead of time to native code for faster startup time and a smaller memory footprint.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We’re very excited to bring the powerful capabilities of Native AOT to developers through the Windows App SDK! In our sample Contoso Camera app, we measured a 50% reduction in start time, an ~8x reduction in package size when using a framework package</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and a ~2x reduction in package size when using Windows App SDK in self-contained mode. While your results might vary, we encourage you to give Native AOT a try if it’s right for your app! </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57148 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Native-AOT-GIF-800-wide-1-loop.gif" alt="GIF of Bloom screensaver moving" width="800" height="291" />

<span data-contrast="auto">For more information about Native AOT, see </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT deployment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. To get started with Native AOT in your Windows App SDK app, see our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.6/1.6.0/release-notes"><span data-contrast="none">release notes for 1.6</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for what you need to know and how to set it up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Decoupled WebView2 versioning</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Instead of embedding a hard-coded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK into the Windows App SDK, we now consume the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference in 1.6. If your app uses WebView2 to display content, you can now choose a newer version of the Microsoft.Web.WebView2 package if you need to instead of the version that came with the Windows App SDK. Additionally, you can now reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK, streamlining your dependencies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">With these updates, we’ve decoupled the WinAppSDK from the Edge WebView2 API surface and brought NuGet’s sophisticated package management capabilities to the WebView2 space. Your WebView2-powered app experiences are now more versatile than ever and can tap into the newest WebView2 offerings at any time!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">New Package Deployment APIs</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Flexible and robust package management has been a mainstay of the Windows App SDK since its inception, and with the release of 1.6 we’re only making it better. We’ve improved package management APIs with new enhancements and quality-of-life updates including package removal, provisioning and detection of pending registration and locally available updates, easy feature availability detection for light-up scenarios and more. If your app uses MSIX packaging, these enhancements are tailored to make your life easier! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">For more details, you can peruse the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453"><span data-contrast="none">pull request here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or take a peek at </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md"><span data-contrast="none">the full spec</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> here.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Improved TabView tab tear-out</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">The WinUI 3 TabView control has received a substantial update to the tab tear-out experience in 1.6 in the form of a new CanTearOutTabs mode, overhauling how a user drags tabs out of your app in a major way. In the new mode, dragging a tab out of your app’s TabView is very similar to the tab drag experience in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome where a new window is immediately created during the drag. This allows users to visually see feedback of their action right away and it lets them drag the new window to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap it in one continuous motion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you enable the new CanTearOutTabs mode in your TabView, you won’t have to worry about any drag-and-drop API limitations because it doesn’t use them. And, you won’t have to worry about whether tearing tabs out of your app will work if the app is run as an Administrator, because that’s supported. The developer and user experiences are seamless and smooth. If your app uses TabView, you should take the new tear-out mode for a spin!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Other control updates</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">While smaller in scale, in 1.6 we’ve added some polish and updates to a few other controls in WinUI 3 as well. PipsPager now supports a new mode that wraps between the first and last items:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">And finally, we’ve added a few other new APIs and features to round things out for 1.6. We filled a gap from UWP with a new ColorHelper.ToDisplayName() API, and we added a new Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages class in MRTCore that includes a new PrimaryLanguageOverride feature for fine-tuning your app’s display language.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
