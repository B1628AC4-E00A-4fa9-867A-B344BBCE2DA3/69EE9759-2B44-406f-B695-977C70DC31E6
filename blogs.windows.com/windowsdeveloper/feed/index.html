										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Reach the right customers at the right time with your games and apps</h3>
Content is at the heart of the Windows PC experience. Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life—moving from smartphones to PCs and back again—the lines between “mobile” and “desktop” have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps—a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.
<h3>Reach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56679" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/02/store-ads-picture-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="547" />

Our passion for helping <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">developers</a> more easily bring their apps to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/11-things-to-know-about-the-new-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">customers</a> inspired us to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">redesign the Microsoft Store</a> on Windows—which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile. Now, when customers visit the Microsoft Store, they can download apps for either mobile or PC.

With Microsoft Store Ads, developers now have new app discoverability opportunities on Windows. <em>Microsoft</em> Store Ads is all desktop traffic, with mission-driven users that have a high intent to download a desktop app. The opportunity is vast; 2022 was a record year, with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">over 900 million unique users worldwide utilizing the Microsoft Store, and a 122% year-over-year increase in developer submissions</a> of new apps and games.

Microsoft Store Ads was designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time, and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.

Whether you're about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.
<h3>All developers are welcome</h3>
We are now offering a new set of <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Open App Store Principles</a> that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/">publishing your Windows app.</a>

<a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/microsoft-store-ads?s_cid=en-us-gct-web-src_ext-sub_0-cam_developerblog-flx_msftstoread">All developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads,</a> where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. However, only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.
<h3><strong>Get started today</strong></h3>
Microsoft Store Ads is built for apps already on Windows—and for your latest release. Now is the time to promote and invest in your desktop app. Having <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">just announced ads on the Microsoft StoreOpens in new window</a>, the costs per click (CPC) are very competitive, which can bring your overall cost per action (CPA) down.

We recommend developers reach out to their marketing team to create a strategic app marketing plan leveraging Microsoft Store Ads. Let the team know that with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">Microsoft Store Ads</a> you promote your desktop app to customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices by creating ads on the Microsoft Advertising platform. Once created, developers will see their app advertised live right on the Microsoft Store. Customers will click the ad, download or update the app to their PC, and let the writing, playing, or gaming come to life.

Choose your way to get started:
<ul>
 	<li>Ask your marketing team to reach out to their Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative.</li>
 	<li>If your marketing team does not have a Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative, <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-advertising-support?s_int=en-us-gct-web-src_msaweb-sub_blog-flx_storeadslaunch">Contact Us</a>.</li>
 	<li>If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/">publishing your Windows app.</a></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Windows App SDK 1.2 is now available! With WinAppSDK 1.2 you can now create widgets for the Windows 11 widget board, use the most modern WinUI controls – including media playback & InfoBadge, and support HDR graphics through the DisplayInformation APIs among other additional features. We have also made several updates to improve platform reliability, stability, and performance to help you create robust, powerful, applications for Windows.

Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful & powerful Windows desktop apps. These APIs and tools can be used in a consistent way by any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app on a broad set of target Windows OS versions. WinAppSDK stays up to date with frequent, OS independent releases and supports the latest innovations in Windows app development – including .NET & Visual Studio.
<h3>Get started with Windows App SDK</h3>
To start using Windows App SDK, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Get started with Windows App SDK</a> to set up your development environment and learn more about the components included in this release. If you want to jump right in with building your first WinUI 3 desktop app, start with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">tutorial</a> or watch our <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/0a0b3638-b56a-49e2-84f5-44eb8441423c?WT.mc_id=learnlive-20220524E">Learn Live session</a> released at Build 2022.
<h2>Functionality introduced in Windows App SDK 1.2</h2>
<h3>Widgets for third-party applications</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56644" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture1-2.png" alt="" width="740" height="600" />

With the launch of Windows 11, we introduced the widgets board featuring content curated by Windows. Widgets provide a glanceable view of important information with one touch access from the taskbar or swipe from the left side of a touch screen and are populated by apps currently installed on the device. Now with the launch of Windows App SDK 1.2, we are excited to make this functionality available for third-party developers to create widgets for their packaged Win32 apps and test them locally on the Windows 11 widgets board through our Windows Insider Program.  By creating widgets for your apps, your customers can easily and seamlessly stay up to date with information that matters to them.

To get started developing Widgets for your app, check out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/widgets/widget-service-providers">Widgets development docs</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/widgets/widgets-design-fundamentals">Widgets design fundamentals</a> for prerequisites, guidance and best practices.
<h3>Latest WinUI controls including media playback</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56645" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/WASDK-UI-Collage.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" data-wp-editing="1" />

WinUI 3 apps can play audio and video with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediaplayerelement?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaPlayerElement</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediatransportcontrols?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaTransportControls</a> media playback controls. For more info on how and when to use media controls, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/media-playback">Media players</a>.

WinUI 3 has been updated with the latest controls, styles, and behaviors from WinUI 2.8. These updates include the addition of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.infobadge"><strong>InfoBadge</strong> </a>control, improvements to accessibility and high contrast mode, as well as bug fixes across controls. For more details, see the release notes for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.7">WinUI 2.7</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.8">WinUI 2.8</a>.
<h3>Voice and video calling in WinUI 3 apps via Azure Communication Services (ACS)</h3>
You can now add <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-calls?pivots=platform-windows">voice</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-video?pivots=platform-windows">video</a> calling capabilities to your WinUI 3 applications that run on Windows, enabling rich communication experiences for desktop PCs. Azure Communication Services use the same infrastructure, services, and technologies that power Microsoft Teams calling experiences.

Check out our conceptual documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features">overview</a> and try out quick starts and samples:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add voice calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add 1:1 video calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>DisplayInformation</h3>
Windows desktop apps can now support High Dynamic Range (HDR) and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/auto-color-management/">Auto Color Management</a> (ACM) through the DisplayInformation class in WinAppSDK. This API is easier to use than ever before for Win32 apps, and app developers can now use one API to target <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/release-health/release-information">Windows version 1809 </a> and later. The DisplayInformation class enables you to monitor display-related information for an application view. This includes events to allow clients to monitor for changes in the application view affecting which display(s) the view resides on, as well as changes in displays that can affect the application view.
<h3>Support for Visual Studio Arm64</h3>
As early as Project Reunion (now WinAppSDK) 0.5, apps developed with WinAppSDK were able to <em>run</em> on Arm64. Starting with Visual Studio 17.3 Preview 2, you will be able to natively develop applications with WinAppSDK on Arm64 devices.

To get started developing on an Arm64 device, check out our docs detailing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/arm/overview">Windows on Arm</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio/">Arm64 Visual Studio</a>.
<h3>Trimming for .NET apps</h3>
You are now able to publish your .NET WinAppSDK apps trimmed. With CsWinRT 2.0, the C#/WinRT projections distributed in the WinAppSDK are trimmable. Publishing your app trimmed can reduce the disk footprint of your app by removing any unused code from trimmable binaries. Your app may also see a startup performance improvement. With a basic Hello World app, we have seen a ~80% disk footprint improvement and a ~7% startup performance improvement when published trimmed. With WinUI gallery, we have seen a ~45% disk footprint improvement.

For more details on how you can enable trimming, trimming limitations (such as reflection against trimmable types), and trim warnings, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained">Trim self-contained deployments and executables</a>.
<h3>Dynamic Refresh Rate</h3>
Introduced in Windows 11, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic Refresh Rate</a> (DRR) enables devices to seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on what users are doing on their PC. This helps to balance performance and power consumption. As part of WinUI 3 in Windows App SDK 1.2, Microsoft.UI.Composition will now support Dynamic Refresh Rate on devices that opt-in to the feature. Notably, through supporting DRR, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22557/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20expanding%20Dynamic,then%20restart%20Edge.">devices running Windows 22H2</a> will automatically have smoother scrolling and interactions in your app without any other changes.

To learn more about how to best support Dynamic Refresh Rate in your app, check out our <a href="https://aka.ms/drrtoolcode">Dynamic Refresh Rate Tool</a> (built on WinAppSDK 1.1) which shows how to use the <a href="https://aka.ms/compositorclock">Compositor Clock API</a> and support SwapChains.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56664" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/11/GIF-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" />
<h3>AppNotificationBuilder</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56647" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture2.png" alt="" width="800" height="386" />

In Windows App SDK 1.1, we introduced the ability to create and send notifications from your application or a cloud service. App notifications can be used to inform the user of application status or state changes, or to prompt the user to take action with engaging and rich UI.

With WinAppSDK 1.2, we’re introducing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.appnotifications.builder.appnotificationbuilder?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">AppNotificationBuilder</a>, an alternative to XML payload to simplify creating and defining these notifications. To get started using the AppNotificationBuilder to create app notifications, check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/release/1.2-preview1/specs/AppNotifications/AppNotificationContentSpec/AppNotificationBuilder-spec.md">AppNotificationBuilder spec</a> on GitHub. Also see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart">Quickstart: App notifications in the Windows App SDK</a> for an example of how to create a desktop Windows application that sends and receives local app notifications.
<h3>Additional updates</h3>
Outside of the new functionality introduced in WinAppSDK 1.2, there are also several performance, reliability, and development experience improvements. Of note, the WinAppSDK 1.2 binary on x64 is 11% smaller than WinAppSDK 1.1.5.

Check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.2/1.2.0/release-notes">release notes</a> for the full list of fixed issues and updates in WinAppSDK 1.2.
<h3>Upcoming experiences on WinAppSDK</h3>
We are working with several development partners internal and external to Microsoft who are migrating their experiences to WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK. Stay tuned on our social channels for more information about these partnerships.
<h3>Staying in the loop</h3>
You can stay up to date with the team on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK GitHub repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI GitHub repo</a>, and through our monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_J2v67C23ZqsolUDaHoFkF1GKvGrttB">WinUI Community Calls</a> where we share roadmap updates and other exciting news, and we demo new features.

You can also connect with us on Twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WindowsAppSDK">#WindowsAppSDK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">@WindowsUI</a>.

We look forward to seeing the beautiful apps you create with WinAppSDK 1.2 & WinUI 3!

Happy Coding!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago we created a code sample for enterprise developers called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/tree/master/">Customer Orders Database</a>, designed to demonstrate how developers can create and manage customer accounts, orders, and products for the fictitious company Contoso.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56601 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1-1.png" alt="Customer Orders Database" width="624" height="412" />

It was very popular, so we continued updating it to support each new version of Windows and the Windows App SDK, and to demonstrate current design guidance. Last year <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/blob/master/windows-11-update.md">we updated it to use WinUI 2.6</a>.

In May of this year, just in time for Microsoft Build, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/customers-orders-database-sample/">we gave it a major overhaul to work with Windows App SDK</a>, and to support the latest Azure features. Of course, we had to make it look at home on Windows 11. So now, based on WinUI 3, the Customer Order Database showcases UI controls including a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/datagrid">data grid</a> from the Windows Community Toolkit.

Making use of Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, Sqlite and SQL Azure database integration, the Entity Framework, and cloud API services.

We hope this is just the beginning for the Customer Orders Database code sample, and we’d like your help making future versions even better.

So we’re asking you, what else should the sample do?

What other features would you like the sample to include? What’s stopping you from using it as the basis for a project in your enterprise? Let us know what you think so that we can start adding features and improving our documentation to meet the communities' specific wants and needs. Our goal is to help you create a solid app, built using current best practices, that you can use as a foundation for your own projects. At the very least, you can examine the code and see how it’s done.

Share your feedback with <a href="mailto:winsam@microsoft.com">winsam@microsoft.com</a> and we’ll follow up with another blog post when we have the next update of the sample.

Thanks!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<h3>July 2022</h3>
It has been exciting to see feedback on the Windows Subsystem for Android™, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mobile-apps-on-windows-abed2335-81bf-490a-92e5-fe01b66e5c48">the core engine behind Mobile Apps on Windows</a> since we first made it available to our Windows Insiders audience last October. While we obviously appreciate the words of encouragement, we also value the suggestions on how we can do better. We’ve been able to act on some of this feedback to make WSA a better product, and we’ll continue to use that feedback to prioritize new features and improvements in the future.

Today we’d like to share more about some of the lesser-known features of WSA, as we believe these are useful tools for users of the product to understand.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Full Screen apps</strong></span></h3>
One of the top pieces of feedback we received when WSA was released last fall was to allow apps to go into “Full Screen Mode”, meaning get rid of the titlebar and taskbar giving users a more immersive experience. We listened, and we have since added that feature. When running an application inside WSA, you can use F11 to toggle it into/out of full screen mode.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Horizontal swipes</strong></span></h3>
We’ve done work to translate mouse scroll wheel events into up and down swipes. If you hold down the Shift key and use the scroll wheel, we’re able to translate that into horizontal swipes. Note, this is also how you can perform horizontal scrolling in native Windows applications.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Two Finger swipes</strong></span></h3>
We’ve seen that some applications want users to use two fingers to perform actions in the app. To simulate that in WSA, if you hold down the ALT button, and then click and drag with the mouse, we’ll send two finger touches and swipes to the application.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Gamepad support</strong></span></h3>
Since WSA came out last October, you can use Xbox-certified gamepads with apps that support gamepad. A couple of our favorites to play with the gamepad include:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56596 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1.png" alt="Hungry Shark Evolution" width="110" height="110" />

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/hungry-shark-evolution/XP9CSV380G9FSB">Hungry Shark Evolution</a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56597 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1.jpg" alt="Talking Tom Hero Dash" width="110" height="110" />

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/talking-tom-hero-dash/XPFFTNVH8NZWR0">Talking Tom Hero Dash</a>

Thank you for all your support with WSA. Please continue to file feedback via the Feedback Hub with any issues or suggestions you might have. Together we can all make this a better product.

Thanks,

- The WSA Team]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[To help you build native, engaging, and modern Windows applications, we’ve just released the 1.1 version of the Windows App SDK. Building off of the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/02/11/window-app-sdk-ecosystem-update/">1.0 release in November 2021</a>, we’re excited to bring several new features and capabilities to the Windows App SDK while increasing its stability & performance.

The Windows App SDK is the starting point for building and shipping Windows desktop apps (spanning C++ and .NET) with WinUI 3 controls and WebView2 for modernized UI development. Keep up to date with new feature updates by participating in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">GitHub repo</a> and following the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md">product roadmap</a>.
<h2>Get Started with Windows App SDK</h2>
To start using Windows App SDK, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Get started with Windows App SDK</a> to set up your development environment and learn more about the components included in this release. If you want to jump right in with building your first WinUI 3 desktop app, start with our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">tutorial</a> or watch our <a href="https://aka.ms/build2022-CLL04">Learn Live session</a> as part of //Build 2022.
<h2>User experience</h2>
Alongside numerous stability improvements, Windows App SDK 1.1 includes several new and updated features across its component areas that you can take advantage of in your applications to delight your users.
<h3>WinUI 3</h3>
WinUI 3 applications are now able to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/signature-experiences/materials">Mica & Background Acrylic</a> materials. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/style/mica">Mica</a> is an opaque, mode-aware material new to Windows 11 that incorporates the user’s background color to delight users and create visual hierarchy. To apply these materials to the backdrop of your application check out the new SystemBackdrop example in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC">WinUI 3 Gallery</a>. The WinUI 3 Gallery has been updated to include several new controls & samples alongside a visual refresh to showcase the Windows 11 design language.
<h3>Notifications</h3>
MSIX-packaged, sparse-packaged, and unpackaged apps can now send Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart">app notifications</a> (also known as toast notifications) and push notifications to inform users when they are not currently using the app. This means you can send app notifications locally or from your own cloud service. You can also send raw notifications from your own cloud service to deliver new updates to your app in a power-efficient and dependable way. Check out our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/toast-ux-guidance">notification UX guidance</a> for best practices around designing useful, productive, and engaging notifications.
<h3>Elevation</h3>
WinAppSDK 1.1 removes constraints from 1.0 that prevented running an app as an administrator. Development, administration, and system management tools can now leverage the full power of Windows App SDK.  For full support, ensure that your target devices have the latest updates for Windows 11 and Window 10 (May 2022 servicing updates). Support for Windows 10 LTSC 2019 is coming in a future servicing update.
<h3>C# Performance Improvements</h3>
C# apps will see significantly improved performance in many different scenarios through updates in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT">WinRT</a> interop layer. In a simple Hello World WinUI 3 app, you can expect to see startup times improved by ~9% compared to our previous WinAppSDK 1.0 release.  Another common scenario where improvements can be seen is with dependency properties in WinUI 3 apps.
<h3>Windowing APIs</h3>
Windowing APIs now allow you to control the relative z-order of your windows. This is a WinRT version of the SetWindowPos’s hWndInsertAfter functionality. Each AppWindow represents a top-level window that you can move above or below other top-level windows. Samples are being written to illustrate the different scenarios for manipulating the relative z-order among your app’s windows.

In custom drawn title bars, you are now able to easily create a tall titlebar (i.e., taller system caption controls and drag region). This allows for a more touch friendly user experience in your app whilst providing more room for interactive content in the title bar such as a search box or person picture. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/title-bar?tabs=wasdk">title bar customization documentation</a> provides more details about how and when to implement a taller title bar.

Another useful feature introduced in this version of Windows App SDK is the ability to change the size of your window based on the client area size. This allows you to set the size of the client area, and then resize the window’s non-client area to match this. In other words, removing the need to calculate the overhead that the non-client area has to get a specific client size.

In addition to these new APIs, there are also changes to the default Presenter applied to an AppWindow when using GetFromWindowId() to get hold of it. The change in behavior is non-breaking in that you will still have a default Presenter of the same type as before (OverlappedPresenter), but it will not block any window style changes coming from outside of the AppWindow/OverlappedPresenter API surface.
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
WinAppSDK 1.1 brings several features that will make your experience easier & simpler when building desktop Windows apps.

App Lifecycle & Restart

With Windows App SDK 1.1, you are now able to programmatically restart your application and set recovery options after app termination due to events such as an app update, app crash, or hang. This means you can recover app state after unexpected restart and your users are immediately back to interacting and engaging with your application. These capabilities are available as part of the new AppInstance.Restart() API in the AppLifecycle class. This is a lifted and synchronous version of the UWP RequestRestartAsync()API now available for both packaged or unpackaged desktop applications.  Check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/AppLifecycle/Restart/restartApi.markdown">Restart API</a> docs on GitHub for usage & reference information.
<h3>Template Studio</h3>
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs">Template Studio for WinUI (C#)</a> is now available! Template Studio is an extension for Visual Studio 2022 that accelerates the creation of new WinUI apps using a wizard-based experience. Projects created with this extension contain well-formed, readable code and incorporate the latest development features while implementing proven patterns and leading practices. The generated code includes links to <> documentation and TODO comments that provide useful insight and guidance for turning the generated projects into production applications. If you’re new to WinUI/Windows App SDK or want more scaffolding like MVVM out-of-the-box in your new projects, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs">Template Studio for WinUI (C#)</a> is a great way to get started!
<h3>Self-contained applications</h3>
Windows App SDK 1.1 introduces support for self-contained deployment where your app carries the WinAppSDK dependencies with it. This enables you to control the WinAppSDK version and use different deployment strategies, like xcopy deployment. Learn about the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/deploy-overview">differences between framework-dependent and self-contained deployment</a> and follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/self-contained-deploy/deploy-self-contained-apps">self-contained deployment guide</a> to get started.
<h3>Bootstrapper APIs</h3>
The Bootstrapper APIs required for using WinAppSDK features (e.g. WinUI 3, MRT Core) in apps that don’t deploy with MSIX are now easier to use and troubleshoot. Updates include a new user UI prompt, additional logging to the event log, and additional options to handle failures including calls to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-debugbreak">DebugBreak()</a> and/or FailFast. These changes were largely motivated by feedback from our community; thank you!
<h3>Environment Variable Manager</h3>
With WinAppSDK 1.1 you are now able to add, remove, and modify environment variables without having to directly use the registry API. Now, changing EVs in the process, user, and machine scope is one unified experience. Additionally, in packaged apps, EV changes made by the environment manager will automatically revert to reduce the amount of EV changes that apps leave behind. Check out <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/AppLifecycle/EnvironmentVariables/AppLifecycle%20Environment%20Variables.md">EV Manager on GitHub</a> for more info.
<h2>Staying in the loop</h2>
You can stay up to date with the team on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK GitHub repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI GitHub repo</a>, and through our monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_J2v67C23ZqsolUDaHoFkF1GKvGrttB">WinUI Community Calls</a> where we share roadmap updates and other exciting news, and we demo new features.

You can also connect with us on Twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WindowsAppSDK">#WindowsAppSDK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">@WindowsUI</a>.

We look forward to seeing the beautiful apps you create with WinAppSDK 1.1 & WinUI 3!

Happy Coding!

We’re excited and humbled by the community participation for these awards. Thank you again for the great nominees, and for picking the apps which are the most important to you!

Finally, thanks to the developers of these apps! We love the diversity of technology used, and the teams who created them. <strong>From individual developers through to distributed projects, open source, and larger companies, you’ve shown that amazing, beautiful, and useful apps can come from development teams of any size and type.</strong>
<h2>Microsoft Store Editor’s Choice Awards</h2>
In addition to community choice voting, the Microsoft Store team selected the best apps for Creativity, Entertainment, Productivity, Social, and one for special recognition.  The Microsoft Store on Windows is home to many great apps and the store catalog continues to grow. Apps were evaluated and selected based on user experience, design excellence, app quality, and customer value. We’re proud to have all the apps we’re showcasing here today in the Microsoft Store on Windows.

Here are the apps we'd like to recognize:
<h2>Special Recognition</h2>
First, there’s one app we’d like to present for special recognition from the editors. The app is <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/talk-for-me/9WZDNCRDM04G">Talk for Me</a> and it was designed to “give those without a voice, a voice.”

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/talk-for-me/9WZDNCRDM04G"><img class="alignnone wp-image-56550" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Talk-For-Me-scaled.jpg" alt="Microsoft Store Editor’s Choice Awards - Special Recognition: Talk for Me" width="800" height="506" /></a>

We found this quote in the product description especially moving:
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"I have ALS [Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]. It took my voice and I have not been able to communicate with my loved ones. I bought an eye gaze device so could access my windows 8 tablet. I found Talk for Me. This app has everything that all the highly priced programs have. it is customizable and very easy to use. Customer service is top notch! I love it! I can finally speak to my family with Talk For Me!"</em></p>
We love that the app embraces a simple, but extremely usable design for the target audience, and that it is so critical to its users.
<h2>Entertainment - Video</h2>
Whether it is for yourself or your family,  Our catalog is filled with so many great TV shows and movies.

The winner of the Video Entertainment category is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/disney/9nxqxxlfst89">Disney+</a>!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thankful and humbled by the response and feedback from the developer community since we <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">announced</a> the new Microsoft Store on Windows last year and our <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Open App Store principles</a> in February. Today, we would like to celebrate the developers that joined us on this journey and share new discoverability opportunities on Windows, the launch of Microsoft Store Ads to help developers reach the right customers at the right time, and new tools for Win32 and PWA developers.

Over the past year, Microsoft Store welcomed thousands of great apps like<strong> ACDSee Gemstone, Adobe Express, Audacity, Canva, Course Hero, Discord, Drawboard PDF, Epic Games, Firefox, Luminar Neo & Luminar AI, Mailchimp, Meitu XiuXiu, Microsoft Teams, OpenOffice, Paramount+, PuTTY, WinZip, and Zoom.</strong> In the first quarter of 2022 alone, we saw more than a 50% increase in new desktop apps and games coming to Microsoft Store compared to the same period last year.

We have also been partnering with Amazon to give Android developers an easy path to bring their Appstore apps to Windows 11. Amazon has already brought thousands of apps and games to Microsoft Store on Windows 11 and will continue to grow the catalog monthly. The <strong>Amazon Appstore</strong> preview is currently available in the U.S., and it will expand to five additional countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, by the end of this year. Learn more <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/appstore-on-windows-11">here</a>.
<h3><strong>New discoverability opportunities on Windows</strong></h3>
Today, we are announcing further steps we are taking to help developers reach and retain new customers through the Microsoft Store:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Windows Search</strong>. When an app is listed in Microsoft Store, Windows Insiders will soon be able to open Start, type the name of an app, view search results from Microsoft Store, and easily install it from there without distracting from their flow. Start is a highly used surface in Windows, and over half of customers search from Start regularly. When customers search from Start, they often search for apps, so Windows Search is a valuable new channel for acquisition of Store apps.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56487" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Windows-Search-Install.png" alt="" width="3009" height="1940" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Restore Apps</strong>. As we noted <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/01/26/a-new-era-of-the-pc/">earlier this year</a>, the PC market saw the biggest growth in a decade. To make it easier for customers to transition to their new PCs quickly and seamlessly, we will soon test a new feature in the Windows Insider channel that helps customers automatically restore their apps, previously installed from the Microsoft Store, to their new Windows device. This will also help developers retain their customers without having to remind customers to re-download their app.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56485" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Restore-Apps.png" alt="" width="3432" height="1443" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pop-up store</strong>. The pop-up store and Microsoft Store badges allow developers to easily promote apps on any website, extending and simplifying the install experience. Find out more about how to create badges <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/app-badge">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Introducing Microsoft Store Ads</strong></h3>
We are also excited to introduce <strong>Microsoft Store Ads</strong>, a new product designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great, engaging content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to make music.

In the coming months, developers will be able to create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store using Microsoft Advertising. Only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.

We will soon kick off a pilot program to test and gather feedback; developers interested in participating can <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=launch&utm_medium=video&utm_source=online">sign up on the waitlist</a>. We look forward to sharing more details in the future.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56482" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Ads-Developer-Experience.png" alt="" width="1872" height="766" />
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56481" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Ads-Consumer-Experience.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /></h3>
<h3><strong>Now open to all Win32 developers</strong></h3>
Last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we’re pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more).

We are also introducing new features designed in response to feedback from the program:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Automating Store Submissions</strong><strong>. </strong>Using the new GitHub Action or Rest APIs, developers will be able to automate and manage app submissions directly from their CI/CD build pipeline. Microsoft PowerToys is a great example. You can learn more <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/microsoft-store-publish">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56489" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-Publish-GitHub-action53.png" alt="" width="800" height="867" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>App visibility</strong>. Developers can now make their Win32 apps undiscoverable to test them with a small group before going live.</li>
 	<li><strong>App telemetry</strong>. Developers will soon be able to access new analytic dashboards to get more insights about their Win32 apps, understand their user acquisition funnel, app usage, health metrics, and install success analytics.</li>
 	<li><strong>App reviews. </strong>Developers can now engage with and respond to reviews on Win32 apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New tools for PWA developers</strong></h3>
Over the past years, <a href="http://www.pwabuilder.com">PWABuilder.com</a> has been the best resource and tool to learn, get started, build, and package quality PWAs and distribute apps to Microsoft Store or other marketplaces.

In partnership with the developer community, we are releasing new capabilities:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>PWA Starter</strong>. This capability helps developers bootstrap their development of PWAs, aiding with performance, integration with the host Operating System, and guidelines for a great user experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>PWA Studio</strong>. This is a new <a href="https://aka.ms/install-pwa-studio">Visual Studio Code extension</a> to help build, package, and publish PWAs to Microsoft Store without leaving Visual Studio Code.</li>
 	<li><strong>Meta Quest support</strong>. PWAs in Microsoft Store are already supported on HoloLens devices, and Meta has recently announced support for PWAs on its VR devices. Microsoft and Meta partnered to make PWABuilder the ultimate tool for packaging PWAs for virtual and mixed reality, giving developers the ability to sideload packages for Meta Quest and HoloLens.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56484" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Microsoft-Store-PWA.png" alt="" width="2011" height="1249" />

We want to thank the developer community for the feedback we have received in the past year and look forward to continuing our partnership to make Microsoft Store on Windows better for all developers and customers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a team, we’re thrilled to spend time with the developer community at <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222022-05-24T00%253A00%253A00-07%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222022-05-26T23%253A59%253A00-07%253A00%2522%257D">Microsoft Build</a>.

Windows is a place where people come to create, to learn, and to connect. One of the most energizing aspects of Windows is how the developer community has been engaging with the platform, bringing value to over a billion people across the planet. Windows is the platform for the world’s innovation, and developers are central to unlocking the next wave of experiences that people will need today and in the future. This is what drives us as a team to innovate and empower developers with the tools to dream big and turn their ideas into reality.

Today, we are sharing new updates to Windows 11 and the Microsoft Store for developers, including:
<ul>
 	<li>New app building tools to enable you to take your existing code and make it incredibly compelling on Windows.</li>
 	<li>New ways to reach and engage customers through the Microsoft Store.</li>
 	<li>A new development kit with AI Capabilities – Project Volterra - and a comprehensive Arm-native developer toolchain.</li>
</ul>
We are building toward our vision for a world of intelligent hybrid compute, bringing together local compute on the CPU, GPU, and NPU and cloud compute with Azure.

In the future, moving compute workloads between client and cloud will be as dynamic and seamless as moving between Wi-Fi and cellular on your phone today.

Increasingly, magical experiences powered by AI will require enormous levels of processing power beyond the capabilities of traditional CPU and GPU alone. But new silicon like neural processing units (NPUs) will add expanded capacity for key AI workloads.

Bringing Azure and Windows closer together will enable you to bring new classes of applications to life for your commercial and consumer customers. This journey begins with Windows 365, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Azure Virtual Desktop and will continue with cloud and NPU processing on more Windows devices.

We will also continue to bridge toward this future, utilizing our open platform, open store, and open hardware ecosystem to empower you to bring your skills, talent, and passion forward.

<h3>New app building tools and Windows subsystem updates</h3>
Our goal with the open platform of Windows is to make it easy for you to build and run your apps on Windows, whether they’re .NET, web, Android, C++, Linux, or any number of cross-platform frameworks. This makes it easy to use Windows for all your developer workflows and distribution models and reach more users to build your business your way.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56500" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/New_App_Building_Tools_Logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

For building Windows desktop apps, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Windows App SDK</a> and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/">WinUI 3</a> platform make it easy to build rich native apps for Windows 11 using C# or C++ while still reaching users on Windows 10. The latest <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK/1.0.1">Windows App SDK 1.1</a> update is in preview and will be released soon, with new features like Fluent visual materials in WinUI 3, updated desktop windowing APIs, enhancements to push notifications, new environment variable APIs for C++, and various performance improvements.

To help with getting started using WinUI 3 to build your app, we’re also updating two tools:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs">Template Studio for WinUI (C#)</a>: this Visual Studio extension makes it easy to get started building a new C# WinUI 3 app. It provides project scaffolding for your app UI, logic, and packaging.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant">.NET Upgrade Assistant</a>: we’re working on an update to this open-source tool to help you automate migration of .NET UWP apps to .NET 6, including updating from WinUI 2 to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/">WinUI 3</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk-ovw">migration guide</a> with more information.</li>
</ul>
For cross-platform app development, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui">.NET Multi-platform App UI</a> (.NET MAUI) 1.0 was just released. .NET MAUI helps you build apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a shared codebase and is built on top of WinUI 3 when running on Windows.

To build great Windows apps using the web, you can create a <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fprogressive-web-apps-chromium%2F&data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=l5J%2Bo3wEOCX9LPvCFrYm9%2B2BRCXk1JVn8cgLDRmEqpY%3D&reserved=0">Progressive Web App</a>, which enables you to distribute and install your site like an app and take advantage of richer OS capabilities. We’re constantly making PWAs more powerful on Windows and have most recently enabled <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fprogressive-web-apps-chromium%2Fwhats-new%2Fpwa&data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2Bt4K4if0zslC%2BEk3CcgtbhWa2EjFDx%2B6zYqCbR3Lii4%3D&reserved=0">new features</a> like URL protocol handler registration and window controls overlay for custom title bars.

You can also use <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.microsoft.com%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fwebview2%2F&data=05%7C01%7CJesse.Bishop%40microsoft.com%7Cb7b33840af0542d526e408da38f2fa1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637884913487996213%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=AnR7OKT3Yx2TzuO%2FgSUo%2Fr%2FNPxU8VC4jhX50k7wJQ%2FU%3D&reserved=0">WebView2</a> to embed web content in your Windows apps using a shared evergreen runtime. WebView2’s shared runtime gives you access to the latest web platform features and security updates at the same time as the Microsoft Edge browser and enables great performance by minimizing disk footprint and runtime costs across apps. There are already thousands of apps taking advantage of WebView2 – including the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-chat-from-microsoft-teams-on-windows-11-for-your/ba-p/2809877">new Teams chat experience on Windows 11</a>, which leverages WebView2 and Fluent Design to create a great user experience. For more on the latest for web developers, see <a href="https://aka.ms/edgebuildblog2022">https://aka.ms/edgebuildblog2022</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) has become an integral tool for many developers, dev-ops engineers, and others with Linux workflows, especially for the cloud and web. To make it even easier to install and update WSL, we <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/">recently made it available in the Microsoft Store</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/android/wsa/">Windows Subsystem for Android™</a> (WSA) is being continually updated to improve compatibility, performance, and extensibility for Android apps running on Windows. This includes updating to Android Open Source Project 12.1.
<h3>New opportunities for app engagement</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56499" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Widgets_UPDATED.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" />

<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/stay-up-to-date-with-widgets-7ba79aaa-dac6-4687-b460-ad16a06be6e4">Widgets in Windows 11</a> provide a fresh, glanceable, and useful view into app content for users. We’re energized by the customer feedback on Widgets to date; people are enjoying the quick access to content most important to them seamlessly without breaking their flow. Beginning later this year you’ll be able to start building Widgets as companion experiences for your Win32 and PWA apps on Windows 11, powered by the <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/">Adaptive Cards</a> platform.

You can also leverage capabilities of touch, pen, voice, and AI, to create features that increase engagement and differentiate your apps with more natural interactions for your customers. Like the natural feel of a haptic pen or Azure text-to-speech capabilities to build transcription. To learn more about how our own apps, like OneNote, are doing this with their updated visual design, incorporating both the Windows 11 look and feel along with pen and voice functionalities, <a href="https://aka.ms/OneNoteRefresh">visit the OneNote Blog</a>.

We also shared an early vision for how apps that create and store content in the cloud could start to integrate that custom content into familiar user engagement surfaces in Windows 11 like File Explorer, and common file dialogs. This would enable Windows to show your app and app content to users in the right context, providing a seamless app installation and content discovery experience across devices. Stay tuned for more on this front.
<h3>New ways to reach and engage customers through the Microsoft Store</h3>
With Windows 11, we rebuilt the Microsoft Store from the ground up for developers: placing their success at its core and designing it to help you run your business with open policies. The Microsoft Store on Windows gives you the choice to use the commerce engine that we provide, with industry-leading revenue share, or your own commerce engine in your app, in which case you get to keep all the revenue.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56498" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Store.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" />

We’re pleased to share the following announcements for the Microsoft Store on Windows:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Microsoft Store is open to all:</strong> We have removed the waitlist program for Win32 applications in the Microsoft Store, opening it up to all app developers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Microsoft Store Ads:</strong> Based on feedback from the developer community, we’re soon piloting new developer tools to help reach the right customers at the right time. Using Microsoft Advertising, developers will be able to create, run and view ad campaigns in the Store, improving discoverability and conversion for apps.</li>
 	<li><strong>Amazon Appstore:</strong> The Amazon Appstore preview on Windows 11 is currently available in the US, and it will be expanding to five additional countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, by the end of this year.</li>
</ul>
The Microsoft Store on Windows is the best place for you to get in front of 1B+ Windows customers that are always looking for new experiences. To learn more about what’s new in the Microsoft Store, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56442">visit this blog post</a>.
<a name="OpenHardware"></a>
<h3>Open Hardware Ecosystem & Project Volterra</h3>
We believe in an open hardware ecosystem for Windows giving you more flexibility and more options, and the ability to support a wide range of scenarios. As such, we are always evolving the platform to support new and emerging hardware platforms and technologies.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56497" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Project_Volterra.png" alt="" width="1900" height="845" />

As we look forward to what is next and how we can further innovate in this space, we are excited to announce Project Volterra, a new device powered by the Snapdragon compute platform. With Project Volterra* you will be able to explore many AI scenarios via the new Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK for Windows toolkit announced today by Qualcomm Technologies.

And because we expect to see NPUs being built into most, if not all, future computing devices, we’re going to make it easy for developers to leverage these new capabilities, by baking support for NPUs into the end-to-end Windows platform.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56495" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Arm-native_Toolchain_logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

To ensure ease of use for our shared customers, we are also announcing a comprehensive end-to-end Arm-native toolchain for Arm native apps, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Full Visual Studio 2022 & VSCode</li>
 	<li>Visual C++</li>
 	<li>Modern .NET 6 and Java</li>
 	<li>Classic .NET Framework</li>
 	<li>Windows Terminal</li>
 	<li>WSL and WSA for running Linux and Android apps</li>
</ul>
You’ll see the first preview of many of these tools in the next few weeks, including VS 2022.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56501" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Open-source_Native_Arm_Logos.png" alt="" width="1900" height="193" />

We’re also hard at work helping many open-source projects natively target Arm including Python, Node, git, LLVM, and more.
<h3>Hybrid Loop</h3>
AI is evolving at a rapid pace. We know that keeping up with the fast-paced evolution has been challenging. We are working on solving this problem for you.

We’ve built a powerful, cross-platform development pattern for building AI experiences that span the cloud and edge. This pattern allows you to make late binding runtime decisions on whether to run inferencing on Azure or the local client. It can also dynamically shift the load between client and cloud.

We are calling it <em>the hybrid loop</em>. And we are bringing this as a cross-platform capability through the ONNX Runtime and Azure ML, along with a Prototype AI toolchain to make heterogenous targeting easy.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56496" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/05/Build_Blog_Hybrid_Loop.png" alt="" width="1900" height="1060" />

And because Project Volterra contains a powerful Neural Processing Unit (NPU), it will be a great device upon which to explore the new Hybrid Loop pattern and the Prototype AI toolchain in Azure ML.

We will be sharing more details on Hybrid Loop and the AI Toolchain soon, so stay tuned.
<h3>Where we are today…and where we are going tomorrow</h3>
We hope you are as excited as we are about where we are today and where we are going tomorrow.

With new app building tools, you can take your existing code and make new and compelling app experiences while reaching your customers in new ways through Widgets and Microsoft Store Ads.

Our emerging model of hybrid compute and AI, along with NPU-enabled devices creates a new developer platform for you to build high ambition apps leveraging incredible amounts of power.

We want you to build cloud-native AI applications. With native Arm64 Visual Studio, .NET support, and Project Volterra coming later this year, we are releasing new tools to help you take the first step on this journey.

You can get started today by building on our cloud and taking advantage of our tooling and services. And it’s just the beginning of what will be possible. We can’t wait to see what you build.

<em>*</em> <em>Product features are subject to change and may vary by market when the product is released. Microsoft will share more details at a later date.</em>

Editor’s note, May 25, 2022: This blog post was updated for clarity in the open hardware ecosystem section.]]></content:encoded>
