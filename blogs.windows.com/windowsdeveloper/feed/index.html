]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Microsoft 2023 Build conference, </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56688"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panos Panay announced ONNX Runtime as the gateway to Windows AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using ONNX Runtime gives third party developers the same tools we use internally to run AI models on any Windows or other devices across CPU, GPU, NPU, or hybrid with Azure. We are also introducing Olive, a toolchain we created to ease the burden on developers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimize models for varied Windows and other devices.  Both ONNX Runtime and Olive contribute to the velocity of getting your AI models deployed into apps.</span>

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-56737 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/ONNX-Runtime-Build-2023-final-1024x539.png" alt="" width="1024" height="539" /></strong>
<h3><b>What is ONNX Runtime?</b></h3>
<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cross-platform, cross-IHV inferencing engine that allows developers to inference across platforms (e.g. iOS, Windows, Android, Linux), across client and cloud devices (CPU/GPU/NPU) or hybrid inferencing between client and Cloud (Azure EP).  EPs are Execution Providers which allow targeting of specific hardware devices on specific IHV hardware (i.e. Qualcomm QNN EP for the Windows on Arm Surface Pro 9 5G) or using DML EP on Windows devices to abstract away which IHV or device is being used.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime makes it easier for you to create amazing AI experiences on Windows and other platforms with less engineering effort and better performance. Olive simplifies the optimization process and eliminates the need for deep hardware knowledge.  ONNX Runtime is the future of AI development on Windows.</span>
<h3><b>What is Olive?</b></h3>
<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/olive.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an extensible hardware-aware model optimization tool that composes cutting-edge techniques across model compression, optimization, and compilation. Olive takes a PyTorch or ONNX model and a configuration file and runs optimization tools to create the most optimal model for a specified hardware device. Olive then produces a package that contains the optimized models, ONNX Runtime, the right ONNX Runtime EP, configuration files, and sample code for that EP. This package can be easily integrated into your app.  </span>
<h3><b>Hybrid inferencing and lighting up NPUs with new EPs in ONNX Runtime </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime now supports the same API for running models on the device or in the cloud, enabling hybrid inferencing scenarios where your app can use local resources when possible and switch to the cloud when needed. With the new Azure EP preview, you can connect to models deployed in AzureML or even to the Azure OpenAI service, starting with the Whisper model. You just need a few lines of code to specify the cloud endpoint and add your own criteria for when to use the cloud. This gives you more control over costs and user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure EP gives you the flexibility to choose between using the larger model in the cloud or the local model at runtime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are the latest silicon that were built from the ground up to support AI workloads and are incredibly energy efficient while offloading workloads from the CPU.   We also support inferencing in browsers with ORT Web and are working with partners on incorporating WebNN.</span>

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-56739 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/MSFT-AI-Blog-Image-2-1024x542.png" alt="" width="1024" height="542" /></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you are excited about these new capabilities in ONNX Runtime and Olive. We encourage you to try them out and share your feedback with us. We are always looking for ways to improve our tools and support more scenarios for our users.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn more about ONNX Runtime and Olive and how they can help you build amazing Windows AI applications with ONNX Runtime, visit </span><a href="https://onnxruntime.ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://onnxruntime.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information and documentation.</span>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The team and I are pumped to be back at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/">Build</a> with the developer community this year.

Over the last year, Windows has continued to see incredible growth fueled by Windows 11 adoption. In fact, one of the most exciting areas driving that growth for Windows has been developers themselves, with a 24% YoY increase in monthly devices used for development.

AI is the defining technology of our time and developers are at the forefront of this transformation. With the right tools we can empower developers and our shared customers to shape the future and leave their mark on the world. We are just starting to see the incredible impact AI is having across industries and in our own daily lives. Today, the team and I are excited to share the next steps we are taking on our journey with Windows 11, to meet this new age of AI.
<ul>
 	<li>We are <strong>introducing Windows Copilot</strong>, making Windows 11 the first PC platform to announce centralized AI assistance to help people easily take action and get things done.</li>
 	<li>We are extending <strong>Bing Chat plugins to Windows, </strong>enabling developers to integrate their apps within Windows Copilot to better serve their customers and increase engagement on native Windows applications.</li>
 	<li>We are introducing new <strong>Hybrid AI loop</strong> to support AI development <strong>across platform, and </strong><strong>across Azure to client with new </strong><strong>silicon support</strong> from AMD, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm.</li>
 	<li><strong>We are introducing Dev Home</strong> designed to help every developer become more productive on Windows.</li>
 	<li><strong>We are introducing new AI features</strong> and experiences in the Microsoft Store on Windows.</li>
</ul>
We can’t wait to share more with you tomorrow during our Windows keynote, <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/sessions/8aab36d1-d27d-46dd-81ec-eb3f49cfee6a?source=sessions">be sure to register for Build and tune in</a>!
<h4><strong>Introducing Windows Copilot for Windows 11</strong></h4>
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfwc-NNo30[/embed]

We’re thrilled to introduce Windows Copilot. Windows is the first PC platform to provide centralized AI assistance for customers. Together, with Bing Chat and first- and third-party plugins, you can focus on bringing your ideas to life, completing complex projects and collaborating instead of spending energy finding, launching and working across multiple applications.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56742 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Windows-Dev-Blog_Windows-Copilot-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" />

Invoking Windows Copilot is familiar and easy – the button is front and center on your taskbar – simple to find and use. Once open, the Windows Copilot side bar stays consistent across your apps, programs and windows, always available to act as your personal assistant. It makes every user a power user, helping you take action, customize your settings and seamlessly connect across your favorite apps. The things you love about Windows – copy/paste, Snap Assist, Snipping Tool, personalization – they are all right there for you, along with every other feature on the platform, and they only get better with Windows Copilot. For example, you can not only copy and paste, but also ask Windows Copilot to rewrite, summarize or explain your content.

Just like you would with Bing Chat, you can ask Windows Copilot a range of questions from simple to complex. If I want to call my family in Cyprus, I can quickly check the local time to make sure I’m not waking them up in the middle of the night. If I want to plan a trip to visit them in Cyprus, I can ask Windows Copilot to find my family flights and accommodations for mid-winter break.

With Bing and ChatGPT plugins in Windows Copilot, people will not only have access to augmented AI capabilities and experiences, but you as developers will also have new ways to reach and innovate for our shared customers. We welcome you to be part of the Windows Copilot journey by continuing to invest in Bing and ChatGPT plugins so your investments will carry forward to Windows Copilot.

<h4><strong>Empowering every Windows 11 developer to be an AI developer  </strong></h4>
This is an incredible time to be a developer on Windows. The possibilities across industries - healthcare, finance, education, tech, and others - are endless. We continue to invest in important tools to democratize how apps will be built for the new era of AI; whether you’re developing on x86/x64 or Arm64 we want to make it easy for you to bring AI powered experiences in Windows apps across cloud and edge.

If you are just getting started with AI or if you are wondering where to start, Microsoft and Windows are here to help you on that journey. Today, we are announcing the Windows AI Library, which will house a curated collection of ready to use machine learning models and APIs that will help jumpstart your AI development.  We will share more details on the availability and preview dates in the coming weeks.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56743 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/ONNX-Runtime-Build-2023-final-1-1024x539.png" alt="" width="1024" height="539" />

<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/create-next-generation-experiences-at-scale-with-windows/">Last year at Build</a>, we announced Hybrid Loop, a new development pattern that enables hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. Today, we are excited to share that our vision has become a reality using ONNX Runtime as the gateway to Windows AI and Olive, a toolchain we created to ease the burden on you when optimizing models for varied Windows and other devices. With ONNX Runtime, third-party developers have access to the same tools we use internally to run AI models on Windows or other devices across CPU, GPU, NPU, or hybrid with Azure.

ONNX Runtime now supports the same API for running models on the device or in the cloud, enabling hybrid inferencing scenarios where your app can use local resources when possible and switch to the cloud when needed. With the new Azure EP preview, you can connect to models deployed in AzureML or even to the Azure OpenAI service. With just a few lines of code you can specify the cloud endpoint and define your criteria for when to use the cloud. This gives you more control over costs and user experience, as Azure EP gives you the flexibility to choose between using the larger model in the cloud or the smaller local model at runtime.

You can also optimize your models for different hardware targets with Olive, an extensible toolchain that combines cutting edge techniques for model compression, optimization and compilation. And you can use ONNX Runtime across platforms like Windows, iOS, Android and Linux, so your Windows AI investment can extend to all your app platforms.

Both <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56722">ONNX Runtime and Olive</a> contribute to the velocity of getting your AI models deployed into apps. ONNX Runtime makes it easier for you to create amazing AI experiences on Windows and other platforms, with less engineering effort and better performance.

<strong>Extending our vision for an AI powered future in collaboration with our partners</strong>

Windows 11 has the largest and most powerful ecosystem of GPUs in the world with more than 200M+ AI capable discrete GPUs. Windows PCs like Surface Studio 2+, and PCs built by partners such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung are powered by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/23/microsoft-build-nvidia-ai-windows-rtx">NVIDIA</a> GPUs. Developers can leverage these GPUs today to run cutting-edge transformer models like Dolly 2.0, Stable Diffusion and NVIDIA’s NeMo that are pre-optimized for Windows.

NPUs (Neural Processing Units) are purpose-built accelerators to run AI models efficiently. Our partners are continuing to innovate and deliver – like <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/05/qualcomm-and-microsoft-align-efforts-to-scale-on-device-ai-at-bu">Qualcomm</a> with the Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 Compute Platform which today enables Windows devices including the Surface Pro 9 5G and the Windows Dev Kit 2023. With Olive &amp; ONNX Runtime you can target Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK to run AI models on the 8cx Gen 3 compute platform NPU.

We are excited to see all our silicon partners bring more Windows devices with NPUs to the market later this year.  <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/corporate/amd-accelerates-ai-adoption-on-windows-11-with-new-developer/ba-p/607847">AMD</a> recently made early access of Ryzen™ AI software available to developers to run AI models on AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors with Ryzen™ AI. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/ai-coming-to-pc-at-scale.html#gs.yj4jwh">Intel previewed</a> their new Meteor Lake product, an all-new chiplet SoC architecture that will feature Intel's first integrated AI engine which will scale across the Windows ecosystem starting later this year and will also make available developer tools, including ONNX Runtime support enabled through OpenVino-EP and DirectML-EP.

Partners such as WhatsApp, Luminar Neo and Camo are achieving incredible leaps in performance and unlocking new end-user experiences by leveraging NPUs to run their AI models.  Bring your apps to the Windows platform and leverage ONNX Runtime to deliver AI experiences like Camo.  We can’t wait to see what the Windows developer community will create with these new AI toolchains and NPU hardware advancements.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We wouldn’t be where we are today without the developer community. Together, we’ve been on a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">journey</a> to reimagine an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">open app store</a> and provide a better experience for Windows customers. It’s because of this partnership that the Microsoft Store on Windows is now used by over one billion customers with more than 50% of new Windows 11 customers engaging with the Microsoft Store in the first 30 days.

The momentum of Windows customers is a testament to the growth in quality content from our passionate community of developers, who have more than doubled the number of Win32 and PWA apps since last year. Engaging PWAs like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/snapchat/9PF9RTKMMQ69">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/espn/9NWD3S85MTFB">ESPN</a>, sophisticated native apps like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/spark-mail-%E2%80%93-email-app-by-readdle/XPFCS9QJBKTHVZ">Spark Mail</a>, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/capture-one/XPDC1MTSBZZ97K">Capture One</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9/XPDDVC6XTQQKMM">Bilibili</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NKSQGP7F2NH">WhatsApp</a>, along with Android apps like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/epic-seven/XP9MK6MFVQBW1X">Epic Seven</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/best-fiends/XPDCF98W6GPBCD">Best Fiends</a>, and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/blink/XP99WSCF81Z8JB">Blink</a>, are truly what makes the Microsoft Store the best place to find the right content, whether for productivity, entertainment or creativity. There are many more apps to recognize, including the winners of the Microsoft Store Awards 2023 which can be found <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56717">here</a>.

<strong>Today, we are proud to share the next phase of our journey for the Microsoft Store on Windows and announce new experiences, features and tools.</strong> We are focused on building an open store that is ready for the new AI era, and to provide developers with new tools like Microsoft Store Ads to reach even more customers.
<h4><strong>Microsoft Store opens the doors to AI </strong></h4>
The world around us is changing every day. As AI disrupts existing workflows and creates exciting new opportunities for customers, we see an opportunity to evolve and think differently about the role of the Microsoft Store on Windows. It’s not just a place to download an app or a game, but rather, it should serve as a resource to educate customers about how they can be more productive, achieve their tasks, and discover new content.

<strong>Introducing</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>AI Hub,</strong> a new curated section in the Microsoft Store where we will promote the best AI experiences built by the developer community and Microsoft. This is a space where we will educate customers on how to start and expand their AI journey, inspiring them to use AI in everyday ways to boost productivity, spark creativity and so much more. For example, you will be able to use AI to express your creativity through <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/luminar-neo-photo-editor/9P7JQGL6GC8P">Luminar Neo</a> and Lensa, master your video and audio with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/descript/XP8BSML4BXT27N">Descript</a>, Krisp and Podcastle, present your ideas with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gamma/9MV4LSCDRFLT">Gamma</a> and Copy.ai, build your resume with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/kickresume/9NBLGGH4RN56">Kickresume</a>, generate your voice with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/playht/9MSVX1XLWJGM">Play.ht</a>, or even plan your trip with Tripnotes. All the content will be tested for security, family safety, and device compatibility – so you are always in control. This feature will soon be available in the Microsoft Store. If you are an AI developer and interested in being featured in the AI Hub, let us know <a href="https://aka.ms/MicrosoftStoreAIHub">here</a>.

<strong>Customers can take advantage of AI-Generated review summary. </strong>This new feature summarizes customer reviews and provides a concise summary highlighting the topline details. We know customers use the Microsoft Store to view and gather community feedback when considering and choosing new apps and games. However, especially with popular apps that have thousands of reviews, sifting through each one can take time. Supported by AI, this feature is designed to make the customer experience even more seamless. AI-Generated review summaries will soon be available in the Microsoft Store.

<strong>Microsoft Store AI-Generated keywords:</strong> Coming soon to preview, we will introduce a new developer tool in Partner Center that leverages AI to generate and suggest Search Tags for apps. We are using AI to consume your metadata, as well as other signals, and help you improve the discoverability of your app in the Microsoft Store search results. Based on popular demand, we are also introducing the ability to select multiple categories per app, which will further improve discoverability and help you reach more customers. <a href="https://aka.ms/aikeywordrecommendations">Learn more here</a>.

<h4><strong>Reach more customers with new developer tools and expanded services</strong></h4>
Earlier this year, we announced the availability of Microsoft Store Ads in search results and shared plans to expand the experience to premium ad placements in search. In just two months, we have seen more developers adopt this new channel and receive positive results. Miracle Games experienced a 25% increase in app installs compared to before at a CPI that is 90% lower than on other advertising channels. <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/stories/miracle-games-increased-app-downloads?s_cid=en-us-acq-onemsft-src_msstore-sub_msstoreemail-flx_storeadsgtm">Learn more about Miracle Games story here</a>.

Today, we are excited to release new services that will help developers connect to more customers and address some of the most popular developer feedback:

<strong>Microsoft Store Ads is expanding in more ways than one</strong>

Starting next month, Microsoft Store Ads will be <strong>discoverable in Bing.com search results</strong>, along with Microsoft Store search results. To take advantage of these capabilities, create a Store Ads Campaign in Microsoft Advertising. We are also making available a new Attribution SDK for MSIX apps and coming soon for Win32 and PWAs. Learn more <a href="https://aka.ms/MicrosoftStoreAds">here</a>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56764 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/bing-search-results-contoso-1024x534.png" alt="" width="1024" height="534" />

Developers now have the option to <strong>display rich advertising in the spotlight section</strong> in the Microsoft Store. This provides a new large and high-traffic surface for advertisers and supports video ad formats. If you are interested in participating in the pilot program, please submit a request <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0qhf-gSatdCgmqCvPskx_NUMkdSMjJXSDlTN1BDMjBTOE5XN1FLWExTRC4u&fswReload=1&fswNavStart=1683832285647">here</a>.

Starting in June, <strong>Microsoft Store Ads will expand beyond the U.S. market</strong>, supported by Microsoft Advertising, to more than 150 regions worldwide. Advertisers with a presence in other countries will soon be able to leverage this channel to achieve their acquisition goals.

<strong>Keeping customers engaged across devices has just gotten easier </strong>

Retention is another key challenge for developers. Last year, we announced a feature that allows customers to easily transition apps from one device to another.

Today, we are <strong>introducing a new backup and restore capability on Windows </strong>that helps keep customers engaged across devices. When customers transition from a Windows 10 or 11 device to their new Windows 11 device, the icons for Store apps will automatically get restored right where they had them – on the Start menu and Taskbar. This new feature is in preview and available to Windows Insiders today. To learn more about how to ensure the best experience when restoring apps, <a href="https://aka.ms/AppRestore">learn more here.</a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are developers, artists, creators, and dreamers and we want to make it as simple as possible to enable everyone to bring their ideas to life. With this new version of Babylon.js, we set out to make it even easier to develop web experiences through the addition of several new tools.
<h3><strong>Node Material Ray Marching</strong></h3>
One of the most used features in Babylon.js is the Node Material. This advanced material type allows you to create incredibly complicated and interactive shaders without writing a single line of code! With Babylon.js 6.0 we’ve done a lot of plumbing under the hood to make it more powerful than ever. With this work it is now possible for developers to build more advanced 3D Graphics techniques into Node Material shaders including things like Ray Marching.

Check out a Ray Marching proof of concept using the new Node Material changes <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34">here.</a>

The following gif is a wonderful demo from Adobe that shows off their own implementation of ray marching using this Babylon.js advancement!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56711 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/6-rayMarching.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<h3><strong>Node Material Tri-Planar and Bi-Planar Projection Nodes</strong></h3>
With Babylon.js 6.0, we’ve also added two exciting new nodes to the Node Material. The new Tri-planar Projection node allows you to project textures onto 3D objects regardless of the mesh UVs. It uses three separate 2D texture projections, one for each axis, and blends them together to create a material without seams. In simpler terms, it’s an advanced way to map textures to a mesh that do not account for the mesh’s UV layout. In addition to the Tri-planar node, we’ve also added a Bi-planar node. It works in a similar way using two 2D textures instead of 3, saving GPU calculations and ultimately leading to seamless textures with a smaller hit to performance!

Check it out: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34">https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34</a>

Here’s a great article by Martin Palko to learn more about tri-planar projection: <a href="https://www.martinpalko.com/triplanar-mapping/">https://www.martinpalko.com/triplanar-mapping/</a>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56712 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/7-planarProjection.gif" alt="" width="500" height="333" />
<h3><strong>GUI Editor v1</strong></h3>
In Babylon.js 5.0 we introduced a GUI Editor Beta, giving you access to a far simpler way to create complex GUI designs for your Babylon scenes. With Babylon.js 6.0, the GUI Editor officially comes out of Beta with the release of version 1! This version builds on the Beta with a ton of stability improvements and bug fixes, but most importantly introduces a tighter connection to your Babylon.js playgrounds. Make a change in the GUI Editor, see it update instantly in your actual scene!

<h3><strong>Figma to Babylon.js Community Extension</strong></h3>
One of the most exciting parts about making open-source software is the incredible community of contributors that roll up their sleeves to help improve and extend it, making it more powerful and beneficial for everyone! With Babylon.js 6.0, we are incredibly grateful to welcome a brand new community extension from <a href="https://github.com/jamessimo">James Simonson</a> that allows you to export <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> GUI designs directly into Babylon.js scenes!

Learn more here: https://doc.babylonjs.com/communityExtensions/figmaToBabylonJS

<h3><strong>Accessibility Screen Reader Support</strong></h3>
When we think about making Babylon.js simpler for developers to use, this also includes making it simpler for developers to communicate with their audience. In the past, developers needed to manually expose content within the canvas to accessibility tools creating a need to manage both canvas elements and DOM elements simultaneously.

With Babylon.js 6.0, we are thrilled to announce that the core Babylon.js scene tree is now visible to screen readers. Thanks to the incredible work from <a href="https://github.com/mysunnytime">Sunny</a>, this advancement means that your favorite accessibility screen reader can now narrate scene elements and text to describe the scene to the user. It’s our sincere hope that this addition will make it significantly easier for developers to create Babylon.js scenes that are more accessible for everyone and especially for visually impaired people across the web.

You can try it out yourself by enabling your OS/Browser screen reader in your settings and opening this playground: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#I6V1ST#240">https://playground.babylonjs.com/#I6V1ST#240</a>

<h3><strong>Reorganized Documentation</strong></h3>
With a platform as feature-rich and advanced as Babylon, helping people learn how to use it is critically important. We’ve listened closely to our community over the past year to restructure the organization of Babylon.js documentation with Babylon.js 6.0. This new organization restructures the same great information in a way that’s more accessible to two core learning paths: those that want to first learn about Babylon.js and its feature set, and those that want to first understand how to integrate Babylon.js into their existing web applications. While there are many different types of learning objectives out there, these two paths represent the majority of new Babylon.js learners and this new documentation structure will better set them up for success as they begin their learning journey in the wonderful world of Babylon.js.

This meaningful documentation restructure was the result of deep thinking and exhaustive work from John King, a devoted teacher and passionate Babylon.js community member who lost a battle to cancer earlier this year. Thank you for teaching us John.

Start your Babylon.js learning journey today!

<h3><strong>Thank You</strong></h3>
With each evolution of Babylon.js comes a revolution in web rendering technology and an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. The Babylon platform simply wouldn’t be possible without the incredible community of developers, the 400+ contributors, and the steadfast advocates that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing technology. “Thank you” to each one of you for all that you do to help make Babylon.js one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple, and open web rendering platforms in the world.

Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life—moving from smartphones to PCs and back again—the lines between “mobile” and “desktop” have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps—a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.
<h3>Reach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56679" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/02/store-ads-picture-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="547" />

Our passion for helping <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">developers</a> more easily bring their apps to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/11-things-to-know-about-the-new-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">customers</a> inspired us to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">redesign the Microsoft Store</a> on Windows—which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile. Now, when customers visit the Microsoft Store, they can download apps for either mobile or PC.

With Microsoft Store Ads, developers now have new app discoverability opportunities on Windows. <em>Microsoft</em> Store Ads is all desktop traffic, with mission-driven users that have a high intent to download a desktop app. The opportunity is vast; 2022 was a record year, with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">over 900 million unique users worldwide utilizing the Microsoft Store, and a 122% year-over-year increase in developer submissions</a> of new apps and games.

Microsoft Store Ads was designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time, and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.

Whether you're about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.
<h3>All developers are welcome</h3>
We are now offering a new set of <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Open App Store Principles</a> that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/">publishing your Windows app.</a>

<a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/microsoft-store-ads?s_cid=en-us-gct-web-src_ext-sub_0-cam_developerblog-flx_msftstoread">All developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads,</a> where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. However, only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.
<h3><strong>Get started today</strong></h3>
Microsoft Store Ads is built for apps already on Windows—and for your latest release. Now is the time to promote and invest in your desktop app. Having <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">just announced ads on the Microsoft StoreOpens in new window</a>, the costs per click (CPC) are very competitive, which can bring your overall cost per action (CPA) down.

We recommend developers reach out to their marketing team to create a strategic app marketing plan leveraging Microsoft Store Ads. Let the team know that with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">Microsoft Store Ads</a> you promote your desktop app to customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices by creating ads on the Microsoft Advertising platform. Once created, developers will see their app advertised live right on the Microsoft Store. Customers will click the ad, download or update the app to their PC, and let the writing, playing, or gaming come to life.

Choose your way to get started:
<ul>
 	<li>Ask your marketing team to reach out to their Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative.</li>
 	<li>If your marketing team does not have a Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative, <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-advertising-support?s_int=en-us-gct-web-src_msaweb-sub_blog-flx_storeadslaunch">Contact Us</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Windows App SDK 1.2 is now available! With WinAppSDK 1.2 you can now create widgets for the Windows 11 widget board, use the most modern WinUI controls – including media playback & InfoBadge, and support HDR graphics through the DisplayInformation APIs among other additional features. We have also made several updates to improve platform reliability, stability, and performance to help you create robust, powerful, applications for Windows.

Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful & powerful Windows desktop apps. These APIs and tools can be used in a consistent way by any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app on a broad set of target Windows OS versions. WinAppSDK stays up to date with frequent, OS independent releases and supports the latest innovations in Windows app development – including .NET & Visual Studio.
<h3>Get started with Windows App SDK</h3>
To start using Windows App SDK, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Get started with Windows App SDK</a> to set up your development environment and learn more about the components included in this release. If you want to jump right in with building your first WinUI 3 desktop app, start with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">tutorial</a> or watch our <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/0a0b3638-b56a-49e2-84f5-44eb8441423c?WT.mc_id=learnlive-20220524E">Learn Live session</a> released at Build 2022.
<h2>Functionality introduced in Windows App SDK 1.2</h2>
<h3>Widgets for third-party applications</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56644" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture1-2.png" alt="" width="740" height="600" />

With the launch of Windows 11, we introduced the widgets board featuring content curated by Windows. Widgets provide a glanceable view of important information with one touch access from the taskbar or swipe from the left side of a touch screen and are populated by apps currently installed on the device. Now with the launch of Windows App SDK 1.2, we are excited to make this functionality available for third-party developers to create widgets for their packaged Win32 apps and test them locally on the Windows 11 widgets board through our Windows Insider Program.  By creating widgets for your apps, your customers can easily and seamlessly stay up to date with information that matters to them.

To get started developing Widgets for your app, check out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/widgets/widget-service-providers">Widgets development docs</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/widgets/widgets-design-fundamentals">Widgets design fundamentals</a> for prerequisites, guidance and best practices.
<h3>Latest WinUI controls including media playback</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56645" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/WASDK-UI-Collage.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" data-wp-editing="1" />

WinUI 3 apps can play audio and video with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediaplayerelement?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaPlayerElement</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediatransportcontrols?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaTransportControls</a> media playback controls. For more info on how and when to use media controls, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/media-playback">Media players</a>.

WinUI 3 has been updated with the latest controls, styles, and behaviors from WinUI 2.8. These updates include the addition of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.infobadge"><strong>InfoBadge</strong> </a>control, improvements to accessibility and high contrast mode, as well as bug fixes across controls. For more details, see the release notes for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.7">WinUI 2.7</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.8">WinUI 2.8</a>.
<h3>Voice and video calling in WinUI 3 apps via Azure Communication Services (ACS)</h3>
You can now add <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-calls?pivots=platform-windows">voice</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-video?pivots=platform-windows">video</a> calling capabilities to your WinUI 3 applications that run on Windows, enabling rich communication experiences for desktop PCs. Azure Communication Services use the same infrastructure, services, and technologies that power Microsoft Teams calling experiences.

Check out our conceptual documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features">overview</a> and try out quick starts and samples:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add voice calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add 1:1 video calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>DisplayInformation</h3>
Windows desktop apps can now support High Dynamic Range (HDR) and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/auto-color-management/">Auto Color Management</a> (ACM) through the DisplayInformation class in WinAppSDK. This API is easier to use than ever before for Win32 apps, and app developers can now use one API to target <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/release-health/release-information">Windows version 1809 </a> and later. The DisplayInformation class enables you to monitor display-related information for an application view. This includes events to allow clients to monitor for changes in the application view affecting which display(s) the view resides on, as well as changes in displays that can affect the application view.
<h3>Support for Visual Studio Arm64</h3>
As early as Project Reunion (now WinAppSDK) 0.5, apps developed with WinAppSDK were able to <em>run</em> on Arm64. Starting with Visual Studio 17.3 Preview 2, you will be able to natively develop applications with WinAppSDK on Arm64 devices.

To get started developing on an Arm64 device, check out our docs detailing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/arm/overview">Windows on Arm</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio/">Arm64 Visual Studio</a>.
<h3>Trimming for .NET apps</h3>
You are now able to publish your .NET WinAppSDK apps trimmed. With CsWinRT 2.0, the C#/WinRT projections distributed in the WinAppSDK are trimmable. Publishing your app trimmed can reduce the disk footprint of your app by removing any unused code from trimmable binaries. Your app may also see a startup performance improvement. With a basic Hello World app, we have seen a ~80% disk footprint improvement and a ~7% startup performance improvement when published trimmed. With WinUI gallery, we have seen a ~45% disk footprint improvement.

For more details on how you can enable trimming, trimming limitations (such as reflection against trimmable types), and trim warnings, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained">Trim self-contained deployments and executables</a>.
<h3>Dynamic Refresh Rate</h3>
Introduced in Windows 11, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic Refresh Rate</a> (DRR) enables devices to seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on what users are doing on their PC. This helps to balance performance and power consumption. As part of WinUI 3 in Windows App SDK 1.2, Microsoft.UI.Composition will now support Dynamic Refresh Rate on devices that opt-in to the feature. Notably, through supporting DRR, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22557/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20expanding%20Dynamic,then%20restart%20Edge.">devices running Windows 22H2</a> will automatically have smoother scrolling and interactions in your app without any other changes.

To learn more about how to best support Dynamic Refresh Rate in your app, check out our <a href="https://aka.ms/drrtoolcode">Dynamic Refresh Rate Tool</a> (built on WinAppSDK 1.1) which shows how to use the <a href="https://aka.ms/compositorclock">Compositor Clock API</a> and support SwapChains.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56664" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/11/GIF-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" />
<h3>AppNotificationBuilder</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56647" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture2.png" alt="" width="800" height="386" />

In Windows App SDK 1.1, we introduced the ability to create and send notifications from your application or a cloud service. App notifications can be used to inform the user of application status or state changes, or to prompt the user to take action with engaging and rich UI.

With WinAppSDK 1.2, we’re introducing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.appnotifications.builder.appnotificationbuilder?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">AppNotificationBuilder</a>, an alternative to XML payload to simplify creating and defining these notifications. To get started using the AppNotificationBuilder to create app notifications, check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/release/1.2-preview1/specs/AppNotifications/AppNotificationContentSpec/AppNotificationBuilder-spec.md">AppNotificationBuilder spec</a> on GitHub. Also see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart">Quickstart: App notifications in the Windows App SDK</a> for an example of how to create a desktop Windows application that sends and receives local app notifications.
<h3>Additional updates</h3>
Outside of the new functionality introduced in WinAppSDK 1.2, there are also several performance, reliability, and development experience improvements. Of note, the WinAppSDK 1.2 binary on x64 is 11% smaller than WinAppSDK 1.1.5.

Check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.2/1.2.0/release-notes">release notes</a> for the full list of fixed issues and updates in WinAppSDK 1.2.
<h3>Upcoming experiences on WinAppSDK</h3>
We are working with several development partners internal and external to Microsoft who are migrating their experiences to WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK. Stay tuned on our social channels for more information about these partnerships.
<h3>Staying in the loop</h3>
You can stay up to date with the team on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK GitHub repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI GitHub repo</a>, and through our monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_J2v67C23ZqsolUDaHoFkF1GKvGrttB">WinUI Community Calls</a> where we share roadmap updates and other exciting news, and we demo new features.

You can also connect with us on Twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WindowsAppSDK">#WindowsAppSDK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">@WindowsUI</a>.
