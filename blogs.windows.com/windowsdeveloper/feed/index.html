<h3><strong>A Peek Ahead</strong></h3>
Phew! Babylon.js 8.0 is by far the platform‚Äôs biggest release to date. There‚Äôs so much goodness packed into it that it feels like you‚Äôve been scrolling forever! Would you believe there‚Äôs even more in active development?!!! Here‚Äôs a tiny tease about a couple of things on the horizon:

<strong>glTF Interactivity Support</strong><strong>‚ÄØ</strong>‚Äî If you follow the advancement of the glTF file format, then you know that exciting things are coming with the interactivity workstream. We‚Äôre actively working on supporting this incredible new extension that will allow asset behaviors to travel with your assets. That means that interactivity is no longer tied to one specific creation tool or engine!

<strong>OpenPBR Support</strong><strong>‚ÄØ</strong>‚Äî‚ÄØ<a href="https://academysoftwarefoundation.github.io/OpenPBR/">OpenPBR</a>‚ÄØis an open standard for how Physically Based Rendered materials look when rendered. Guess what‚Äôs in active development in Babylon? üòâ

<strong>Tooling For Everyone</strong><strong>‚ÄØ</strong>‚Äî We understand that everyone who comes to the Babylon platform comes from different backgrounds and experience levels, from software engineers at the top of their game, to students and artists just beginning their computer graphics journey. We are passionate about ensuring that everyone who is interested in leveraging Babylon.js has the tools and workflows to do so. We‚Äôll have more to share on this later this year.
<h3><strong>Thank You</strong></h3>
With each evolution of Babylon.js comes a revolution in web rendering technology and an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. The Babylon platform simply wouldn‚Äôt be possible without the incredible community of developers, the 500+ contributors, and the steadfast advocates that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help and passion to this amazing technology. ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to each one of you for all that you do to help make Babylon.js one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple and open web rendering platforms in the world.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our mission is to build one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple and open web rendering engines in the world. Today, web graphics and rendering hit the accelerator with the release of Babylon.js 8.0.

https://youtu.be/kKaomUggipQ

Babylon.js 8.0 represents a year of new features, optimizations and performance improvements aimed at helping you create more compelling, interactive web experiences faster than ever.
<h3><strong>IBL Shadows</strong></h3>
Image-Based Lighting (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">IBL</a>) is a computer graphics lighting technique that approximates environment lighting based on a source image. Originating in the visual effects world as a way to blend computer-generated effects with real photography, IBL has become a ubiquitous tool for computer graphics wizards around the world.

Babylon.js first introduced support for IBL over 8 years ago and it has quickly become one of the most commonly used features of the engine.

Today, we are absolutely thrilled to announce that our good friends at Adobe leveled up IBL in Babylon by adding shadows to the mix! Yup, that‚Äôs right, now both light and shadows for the scene environment can be approximated from a source image. Special shout out to Michael Bond at Adobe for his incredible work on this!

Check out a demo: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon8IBLShadows">https://aka.ms/babylon8IBLShadows</a>

https://youtu.be/xVLyy7N4Us8
<h3><strong>Area Lights</strong></h3>
We are thrilled to announce that Babylon.js 8.0 brings a frequently requested feature‚Ä¶Area Lights! This amazing new addition to the lighting palette allows you to specify a 2D shape that emits light from it, much like a large diffuse light that you might find on a movie set! We can‚Äôt wait to see how you use this new light type to bring a new dimension to your scene!

Learn more here: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon8AreaLightsDoc">https://aka.ms/babylon8AreaLightsDoc</a>

https://youtu.be/U1FdTyTlJsU
<h3><strong>Node Render</strong><strong>‚ÄØGraph - Alpha</strong></h3>
One of the most powerful new features in Babylon.js 8.0 is something we call the ‚ÄúNode Render Graph.‚Äù

Up to now, the specific rendering pipeline for Babylon has been a black box. You tell Babylon what to render and it goes off and does it for you. There have been observables that allow you to manipulate the result after completion of a render, but the render process itself has been opaque. Well‚Ä¶not anymore!

With Babylon.js 8.0 you now have full control of the entire render pipeline. This means that you can fully customize and control every part of the process of how your frames are rendered on the GPU. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, you also now have a fancy new Node Graph tool to allow you to customize your own render pipeline, without writing complex render process code! Please note that the Node Render Graph is in Alpha for you to test and discover but should not be used in production yet as it is subject to change.

<h3><strong>All New Lightweight Viewer</strong></h3>
Babylon.js is a powerful tool used by tens of thousands of people and organizations across the globe to bring complex visual ideas to life on the web. Babylon.js 8.0 unlocks a new super-powered tool for the other end of the spectrum‚Ä¶those scenarios where you want to display a simple 3D object on a web page with zero complexity, and stunning visuals in a tiny package.

Introducing the all new Babylon.js Lightweight Viewer. This new viewer is designed to harness the same rendering beauty and power of the full engine but comes in a smaller bundle footprint and uses dynamic imports and capabilities (audio or animation for example) depending on the model that is loaded. It can be added to any web page with just a few lines of HTML and is also fully extensible!

Of course, this new Lightweight Viewer wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a super easy-to-use configurator along with it! The Viewer Configurator is a simple tool that allows you to customize the Viewer to your exact specifications and give you the simple .html properties to set so it looks the same in your website!

https://youtu.be/HmkkGE96Xb4
<h3><strong>WGSL Core Engine</strong><strong>‚ÄØShaders</strong></h3>
Babylon.js has had support for WebGPU since its inception. The core engine shaders in Babylon.js, however, have been written in GLSL (WebGL shading language) from the beginning. Because WebGPU has its own shading language (WGSL) this posed a very interesting challenge. How do you get GLSL shaders to render in WebGPU? Fortunately, there is a conversion library that‚Äôs been available. So, anyone wanting to target WebGPU with Babylon can leverage this library to convert the Babylon shaders into something WebGPU can use. The downside of this is that this conversion library is over 3MB, requiring users to double their download size for a standardBabylon.js project.

With Babylon 8.0, this problem is a thing of the past. All of the core engine shaders for Babylon.js are now available in both GLSL and WGSL. This means direct support for WebGPU right out of the box with no conversion layer, essentially making Babylon.js 2x smaller when targeting WebGPU than in the past!

Check out a demo: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon8WGSLDemo">https://aka.ms/babylon8WGSLDemo</a> (try switching between WebGL2 and WebGPU)

Learn more here: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon8WGSLDoc">https://aka.ms/babylon8WGSLDoc</a>

https://youtu.be/pKyGxT5xyUs
<h3><strong>NME -> WGSL</strong><strong>‚ÄØSupport</strong></h3>
Well, why stop at core engine shaders? Why not unlock the ability to create custom WGSL shaders using Babylon‚Äôs <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/nme/">Node Material Editor</a> as well!

OK! Check!

Ability Unlocked! Let‚Äôs go Babylon 8.0!!!!!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[At Microsoft, we believe the future of AI is happening now‚ÄØ‚Äî spanning from the cloud to the edge. Our vision is bold: to build Windows as the ultimate platform for AI innovation, where intelligence isn‚Äôt just in the cloud but seamlessly woven throughout the system, silicon and hardware at the edge. Building on our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/01/29/running-distilled-deepseek-r1-models-locally-on-copilot-pcs-powered-by-windows-copilot-runtime/">recent announcement</a> of bringing NPU-optimized versions of DeepSeek-R1 1.5B distilled model directly to Copilot+ PCs, we‚Äôre taking the next step forward with the availability of DeepSeek R1 7B &amp; 14B distilled models for Copilot+ PCs via Azure AI Foundry. This milestone reinforces our commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI capabilities that are fast, efficient and built for real-world applications ‚Äî helping developers, businesses and creators push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GotHKdBQPw4

Availability starts with Copilot+ PCs powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X, followed by Intel Core Ultra 200V and AMD Ryzen.

The ability to run 7B and 14B parameter reasoning models on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/all-about-neural-processing-units-npus-e77a5637-7705-4915-96c8-0c6a975f9db4">Neural Processing Units (NPUs)</a> is a significant milestone in the democratization and accessibility of artificial intelligence. This progression allows researchers, developers and enthusiasts to leverage the substantial power and functionalities of large-scale machine learning models directly from their Copilot+ PCs. These Copilot+ PCs include an NPU capable of over 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS).
<h3><strong>NPUs are purpose-built to run AI models locally on-device with exceptional efficiency¬†</strong></h3>
NPUs like those built into Copilot+ PCs are purpose-built to run AI models with exceptional efficiency, balancing speed and power consumption. They ensure sustained AI compute with minimal impact on battery life, thermal performance and resource usage. This leaves CPUs and GPUs free to perform other tasks, allowing reasoning models to operate longer and deliver superior results ‚Äî all while keeping your PC running smoothly.

Efficient inferencing has heightened significance due to a new scaling law for language models, which indicates that chain of thought reasoning during inference can improve response quality across various tasks. The longer a model can ‚Äúthink,‚Äù the better its quality will be. Instead of increasing parameters or training data, this approach taps into additional computational power for better outcomes. DeepSeek distilled models exemplify how even small pretrained models can shine with enhanced reasoning capabilities and when coupled with the NPUs on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/">Copilot+ PCs</a>, they unlock exciting new opportunities for innovation.

Reasoning emerges in models of a certain minimum scale, and models at that scale must think using a large number of tokens to excel at complex multi-step reasoning. Although the NPU hardware aids in reducing inference costs, it is equally important to maintain a manageable memory footprint for these models on consumer PCs, say with 16GB RAM.
<h3><strong>Pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on Windows</strong></h3>
Our research investments have enabled us to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on Windows even further at the system level and at a model level leading to innovations like Phi Silica. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/12/06/phi-silica-small-but-mighty-on-device-slm/">With our work on Phi Silica</a> we were able to create a scalable platform for low-bit inference on NPUs, enabling powerful performance with minimal memory and bandwidth tax. Combined with the data privacy offered by local compute, this puts advanced scenarios like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)‚ÄØand model fine-tuning at the fingertips of application developers.

We reused techniques such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456">QuaRot</a>, sliding window for fast first token responses and many other optimizations to enable the DeepSeek 1.5B release. We used Aqua, an internal automatic quantization tool, to quantize all the DeepSeek model variants to int4 weights with QuaRot, while retaining most of the accuracy. Using the same toolchain we used to optimize Phi Silica we quickly integrated all the optimizations into an efficient <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html">ONNX QdQ</a> model with low precision weights.

Like the 1.5B model, the 7B and 14B variants use 4-bit block wise quantization for the embeddings and language model head and run these memory-access heavy operations on the CPU. The compute-heavy transformer block containing the context processing and token iteration uses int4 per-channel quantization for the weights alongside int16 activations. We already see about 8 tok/sec on the 14B model (the 1.5B model, being very small, demonstrated close to 40 tok/sec) ‚Äî and further optimizations are coming in as we leverage more <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764">advanced techniques</a>. With all this in place, these nimble language models think longer and harder.

This durable path to innovation has made it possible for us to more quickly optimize larger variants of DeepSeek models (7B and 14B) and will continue to enable us to bring more new models to run on Windows efficiently.
<h3><strong>Get started today</strong></h3>
Developers can access all distilled variants (1.5B, 7B and 14B) of DeepSeek models and run them on Copilot+ PCs by simply downloading the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/toolkit/toolkit-getting-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;tabs=rest">AI Toolkit VS Code extension</a>. The DeepSeek model optimized in the ONNX QDQ format is available in AI Toolkit‚Äôs model catalog, pulled directly from Azure AI Foundry. You can download it locally by clicking the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button. Once downloaded, experimenting with the model is as simple as opening the Playground, loading the ‚Äúdeepseek_r1_1_5‚Äù model and sending it prompts.
<h3><strong>Run models across Copilot+ PCs and Azure</strong></h3>
Copilot+ PCs offer local compute capabilities that are an extension of capabilities enabled by Azure, giving developers even more flexibility to train, fine-tune small language models on-device and leverage the cloud for larger intensive workloads. In addition to the ONNX model optimized for Copilot+ PC, you can also try the cloud-hosted source model in Azure Foundry by clicking on the ‚ÄúTry in Playground‚Äù button under ‚ÄúDeepSeek R1.‚Äù AI Toolkit is part of your developer workflow as you experiment with models and get them ready for deployment. With this playground, you can effortlessly test the DeepSeek models available in Azure AI Foundry for local deployment too. Through this, developers now have access to the most complete set of DeepSeek models available through the Azure AI Foundry from cloud to client.

Copilot+ PCs pair efficient compute with the near infinite compute Microsoft has to offer via its Azure services. With reasoning able to span the cloud and the edge, running in sustained loops on the PC and invoking the much larger brains in the cloud as needed ‚Äî we are on to a new paradigm of continuous compute creating value for our customers. The future of AI compute just got brighter! We can‚Äôt wait to see the new innovations from our developer community taking advantage of these rich capabilities. Please keep the feedback coming!]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Update: Feb. 3, 2025:</strong> Today, we are pleased to announce that the distilled DeepSeek R1 models optimized using ONNX are now available to use on your Snapdragon powered Copilot+ PCs. With further optimizations in place, the model is capable of a time to first token of less than 70 ms for short prompts (&lt;64 tokens) and a throughput rate of up to ~40 tokens/s. The time to first token scales with the length of the input prompt. The throughput rate varies based on the complexity of the task specified in the prompt; responses exhibit a throughput range of ~25-40 tokens/s. Longer responses are especially likely to enjoy higher throughput rates. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/toolkit/toolkit-getting-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;tabs=rest">Get started today by downloading the AI Toolkit extension in VS Code</a>.</em>

AI is moving closer to the edge, and Copilot+ PCs are leading the way. With the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/?p=38333">availability of cloud hosted DeepSeek R1 available on Azure AI Foundry</a>, we‚Äôre bringing NPU-optimized versions of DeepSeek-R1 directly to Copilot+ PCs, starting with Qualcomm Snapdragon X first, followed by Intel Core Ultra 200V and others. The first release, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B">Source</a>), will be available in AIToolkit for VSCode, with the 7B (<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B">Source</a>) and 14B (<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B">Source</a>) variants arriving soon. These optimized models let developers build and deploy AI-powered applications that run efficiently on-device, taking full advantage of the powerful NPUs in Copilot+ PCs.

The <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/all-about-neural-processing-units-npus-e77a5637-7705-4915-96c8-0c6a975f9db4">Neural Processing Unit (NPU)</a> on Copilot+ PCs offers a highly efficient engine for model inferencing, unlocking a paradigm where generative AI can execute not just when invoked, but enable semi-continuously running services. This empowers developers to tap into powerful reasoning engines to build proactive and sustained experiences.

<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/12/06/phi-silica-small-but-mighty-on-device-slm/">With our work on Phi Silica</a>, we were able to harness highly efficient inferencing ‚Äì delivering very competitive time to first token and throughput rates, while minimally impacting battery life and consumption of PC resources. Running models on the NPU is about speed and efficiency. For example, as mentioned in previous posts, the Phi Silica token iterator on the NPU exhibits a 56% improvement in power consumption compared to operating on the CPU. Such efficiency enables new experiences that demand such state-of-the art models to be in the main loop of the program without draining your battery or overly heating your device. The optimized DeepSeek models for the NPU take advantage of several of the key learnings and techniques from that effort, including how we separate out the various parts of the model to drive the best tradeoffs between performance and efficiency, low bit rate quantization and mapping transformers to the NPU. Additionally, we take advantage of Windows Copilot Runtime (WCR) to scale across the diverse Windows ecosystem with <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/">ONNX</a> QDQ format.

<strong>Get ready to play!</strong>

First things first‚Ä¶let‚Äôs give it a whirl.

To see DeepSeek in action on your Copilot+ PC, simply download the AI Toolkit VS Code extension. The DeepSeek model optimized in the ONNX QDQ format is available in AI Toolkit‚Äôs model catalog, pulled directly from Azure AI Foundry. You can download it locally by clicking the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button. Once downloaded, experimenting with the model is as simple as opening the Playground, loading the ‚Äú deepseek_r1_1_5‚Äù model, and sending it prompts.

In addition to the ONNX model optimized for Copilot+ PC, you can also try the cloud-hosted source model in Azure Foundry by clicking on the ‚ÄúTry in Playground‚Äù button under ‚Äú DeepSeek R1‚Äù.

AI Toolkit is part of your developer workflow as you experiment with models and get them ready for deployment. With this playground, you can effortlessly test the DeepSeek models available in Azure AI Foundry for local deployment.

<strong>Silicon Optimizations </strong>

The distilled Qwen 1.5B consists of a tokenizer, embedding layer, a context processing model, token iteration model, a language model head and a de-tokenizer. We use 4-bit block wise quantization for the embeddings and language model head and run these memory-access heavy operations on the CPU. We focus the bulk of our NPU optimization efforts on the compute-heavy transformer block containing the context processing and token iteration, wherein we employ int4 per-channel quantization for the weights alongside int16 activations.

Details of the various precisions involved are in the table below, for additional clarity on the mix.
<table style="margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; display: block;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="207"><strong>Model</strong></td>

<td width="207">w: int4 a: fp32</td>
<td width="207">CPU</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
While the Qwen 1.5B release from DeepSeek does have an int4 variant, it does not directly map to the NPU due to presence of dynamic input shapes and behavior ‚Äì all of which needed optimizations to make compatible and extract the best efficiency. Additionally, we use the <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html">ONNX QDQ</a> format to enable scaling across a variety of NPUs we have in the Windows ecosystem. We work out an optimal operator layout between the CPU and NPU for maximum power-efficiency and speed.

To achieve the dual goals of low memory footprint and fast inference, much like Phi Silica, we make two key changes: First, we leverage a sliding window design that unlocks super-fast time to first token and long context support despite not having dynamic tensor support in the hardware stack. Second, we use the 4-bit <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/quarot-outlier-free-4-bit-inference-in-rotated-llms/">QuaRot</a> quantization scheme to truly take advantage of low bit processing. QuaRot employs Hadamard rotations to remove outliers in weights and activations, making the model easier to quantize. QuaRot significantly improves quantization accuracy, compared to existing methods, such as GPTQ, particularly for low granularity settings such as per-channel quantization. The combination of low-bit quantization and hardware optimizations such the sliding window design help deliver the behavior of a larger model within the memory footprint of a compact model. With these optimizations in place, the model is capable of a time to first token of 130 ms and a throughput rate of 16 tokens/s for short prompts (&lt;64 tokens).

We include examples of the original and quantized model responses below to show the minor differences between the two variants, with the latter being both fast and power-efficient:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57336 size-large" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/3/2025/01/originalleft_deepseekr1_1.5-1024x592.png" alt="Sample response from the original model" width="1024" height="592" />

The model follows a similar reasoning pattern, and reaches the same answer, demonstrating that the optimized model retains the reasoning ability of the original model.¬†</em>

With the speed and power characteristics of the NPU-optimized version of the DeepSeek R1 models users will be able to interact with these ground-breaking models entirely locally. We are excited what this capability enables for the future of the PC experience and looking forward towards innovations from our developer community.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your feedback matters ‚Äì each week, we get thousands of feedback submissions that we triage, categorize and prioritize. We love the enthusiasm our customers and developers show daily for the Store and all its apps and games ‚Äì and as product makers, we take that energy forward every day into our craft. Our ultimate goal is to build the best product for <em>you</em>.

Today, we‚Äôre excited to recap some important quality updates to the Microsoft Store on Windows that we‚Äôve rolled out over the last few months.
<h3>Upping the ante on performance</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-57179 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/performance-1024x683.png" alt="Decorative image of anthropomorphic Store logo running" width="1024" height="683" />

We have some meaningful improvements to share from our recent work on performance. Overall Store launch time has been reduced by 25%, and we've reduced the number of download hanging issues by 50%<sup>1</sup>. To make sure you see the latest improvements, ensure you have the latest Windows update. We are continually striving for improvements in this space because we know how influential it is to your Store experience.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57180 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/New-download-indicator-1024x576.png" alt="Install button showing progress bar, percentage and number of MB downloaded from the total" width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>New download and install progress indicator</strong> ‚Äì We‚Äôve rebuilt the way we‚Äôre communicating download and install progress to you when you‚Äôre getting content from a Product Page. This is especially important when you‚Äôre downloading larger apps. You also can cancel an operation right from a Product Page if you‚Äôve accidentally clicked download.
<h3>Improved browse and Product Page experiences</h3>
We‚Äôve revamped a few places where we know customers go to find and acquire content.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57182 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/App-categories-1024x683.png" alt="A row of buttons on the gaming page are highlighted " width="1024" height="683" /><strong>Apps and games categories </strong>‚Äì We‚Äôve introduced new categorizations of apps and games to help you narrow down what you‚Äôre looking for. From the Gaming page, you can now navigate easily and quickly through different game categories such as strategy, role-playing, puzzle and simulation.‚ÄØFor Apps, we are experimenting with different categories so please keep an eye out for the experience and give us feedback!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57181 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/New-PDP-1024x576.png" alt="Product Page interface with large product screenshots and text overlaying trailer background " width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>Immersive Product Pages </strong>‚Äì We‚Äôre introducing a new feature for Product Pages that adds an immersive experience to the top of the page. For apps and games that provide a trailer, you‚Äôll be able to enjoy it as you navigate to their various pages. Meanwhile, products without trailers will use beautiful hero images provided by the developers. There‚Äôs also an option in the Store settings page to toggle video autoplay on or off.
<h3>New Library, Updates and downloads pages</h3>
We know this one‚Äôs a crowd favorite ‚Äì we‚Äôve introduced two new pages, Library, and Updates and downloads, to help you find and manage all your content.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57183 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Library-1024x683.png" alt="Search button on top right corner of Library page highlighted" width="1024" height="683" />

<strong>Redesigned Library page</strong> ‚Äì We made two big changes here. First, we changed the default filters to show all the products you own, not just products that are installed (you can still toggle this filter if you wish). Second, we‚Äôve added a search bar that will help you find the name or the publisher of products you‚Äôre looking for.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57184 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Downloads-1024x576.png" alt="Downloads page showing an app with developer notes in progress of updating" width="1024" height="576" />

<strong>New Updates and downloads page</strong> ‚Äì We are also moving the list of updates and downloads from the top section of the Library to its own dedicated page. This new page displays your list of active downloads or pending updates, and it shows the list of recent installs or updates. Version notes will also be displayed for a pending update or active download.
<h3>But wait‚Ä¶there‚Äôs more!</h3>
There‚Äôs a long list of other improvements we‚Äôve quietly rolled out, such as Win32 apps support for our Store Web Installer on web, design updates, search recommendations, and easier ways to update Win32 apps from the Downloads and Product pages (this last feature is accessible via Windows Insiders starting Dec. 4). Lastly, our catalog continues to grow ‚Äì we recently welcomed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NT1R1C2HH7J">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p0kn9s5rp86">Fantastical</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPDM5VSMTKQLBJ">Battle.net</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP9CKPHR0JP7F7">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFMDW72VHTTX9">Arc</a> and more!¬† We also recently announced our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/11/01/announcing-the-microsoft-store-awards-2024-winners/">2024 Store Awards</a>, and encourage you to check out the winning apps and games to find new AI experiences, gaming content, productivity tools and more!

We hope these improvements spark a bit more joy as you‚Äôre using the Store on Windows. Please submit your product feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Microsoft Store. And we are always publishing new updates, so leverage the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù page to keep track of the latest.

We have a lot more fun in store for you in 2025 ‚Äì stay tuned!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[October was an exciting month of amazing showcases and announcements for applications leveraging the power of the NPU on the new Copilot+ PCs to deploy their AI innovations on Windows. Windows‚Äô diverse hardware ecosystem empowers developers with a range of options at their fingertips to develop and deploy AI. From client to web apps, DirectML, foundational to <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/">Windows Copilot Runtime</a>, aims to uniquely simplify how developers can scale their AI innovations across Windows. Through a single, cross-hardware DirectX API, DirectML works across different hardware architectures, local device accelerators and machine learning frameworks, supporting an open platform for AI on Windows.

Let‚Äôs see some of the amazing AI innovations leveraging DirectML on Copilot+ PC NPUs.
<h2>Adobe¬Æ Premiere¬Æ Pro is the first Adobe app to leverage NPU on Copilot+ PCs, powered by Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ Ultra and DirectML</h2>
Adobe is at the forefront of machine learning (ML) for creatives by providing a variety of hardware-accelerated features throughout their product suite. Now, Adobe Premiere Pro has enabled the machine learning efficiency of the latest Intel Core Ultra processors, opening up even more platform possibilities for Adobe customers.

Through collaboration with Intel and Microsoft, Adobe enabled Audio Category Tagger to optionally utilize Intel‚Äôs latest generation NPU using DirectML as a beta capability in Premiere Pro. This feature automatically tags audio, classifying clips as sound effects, music, dialog or ambience, which makes it easy for creatives to just get started editing their audio files right away.¬†Each clip is marked with an Essential Sound Badge, and clicking on that badge opens the Essential Sound Panel to give access to parameters needed for that sound category.

[caption id="attachment_57164" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57164 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Adobe-Premier-Pro-Audio-Category-Tagger-1024x331.png" alt="A screen capture of Premier Pro showing audio clips marked by icons indicating audio categories A, B, C, and D. A is Music, B is SFX, C is Dialogue, and D is Ambience." width="1024" height="331" /> Audio Category Tagger labeling A. Music B. SFX C. Dialogue D. Ambience[/caption]

We are excited to partner with an AI innovator like Adobe to deliver on the promise of DirectML. Adobe‚Äôs extensive portfolio of applications and AI-driven scenarios offers a unique proving ground for DirectML and we‚Äôll continue our partnership across GPU- and NPU-accelerated applications.
<h2>Capture One to bring NPU-enhanced Match Look and AI Crop features to Copilot+ PCs</h2>
<strong>Capture One</strong> is an imaging software commercial studio photographers use in the fashion and e-commerce industries.¬†It helps professionals quickly edit many images while maintaining complete control over the creative expression and artistry behind every shot.¬†At Snapdragon Summit, Capture One showcased two advanced AI-powered features on Copilot+ PCs powered by the Qualcomm NPU.

[caption id="attachment_57165" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57165 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Capture-One-Match-Look-1024x575.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Capture One application, where the Match Look feature is being applied to an image of a woman holding pears to her ears." width="1024" height="575" /> The Match Look feature being applied to an image in Capture One[/caption]

<strong>Match Look</strong>‚ÄØis a brand new tool that lets you instantly match the style or edits of a reference image ‚Äî whether from a previous project, a film still or a mood board. It uses AI selection to dynamically adjust multiple editing sliders, giving you a strong starting point for editing and color grading.

[caption id="attachment_57167" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57167 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Capture-One-Ai-Crop-1024x575.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Capture One application where there is a crop reference set on an image of a purse in order to use the AI Crop feature. AI Crop is displayed on the right hand side of the screenshot where it's consistently applying the crop to other images." width="1024" height="575" /> The AI Crop feature in use in Capture One[/caption]

<strong>AI Crop </strong>allows you to make instant and consistent crops. Avoid errors and reduce manual effort. Set a crop reference on a single photo and automatically create consistent crops for all other images, even while shooting.

Capture One continues to utilize AI innovation in a way that maintains the creative artistry their photographers required and DirectML is excited to partner with them to bring their vision to life.
<h2>Affinity Photo 2 accelerates Object and Subject Selection capabilities with NPU</h2>
Affinity Photo 2 is a popular image-editing app that is used by millions of digital creators worldwide. Human creativity is the heart of Affinity products, so it‚Äôs no surprise that the first AI enhanced tools they announced are focused on optimizing artist workflows ‚Äî eliminating tedious tasks and friction between creator and canvas. Affinity Photo 2 will scale these features to their creator base by using DirectML on Copilot+ PCs. Like stated during the Snapdragon Summit, they have already achieved the optimized workflow of these AI experiences with DirectML, powered by the Qualcomm¬Æ Hexagon NPU in the Snapdragon<sup>¬Æ</sup> X Elite Compute Platform.

<strong>Object Selection</strong> is a newly announced feature that eliminates the grunt work of manually creating layer masks, by using ML to quickly isolate and segment objects within an image. Automating this process gives artists a shortcut to the ‚Äòreal‚Äô creative work ‚Äî applying visual adjustments and effects to targeted areas within an image. Using the Qualcomm¬Æ Hexagon NPU in the Snapdragon<sup>¬Æ</sup> X Elite Compute Platform, Object Selection tasks will increase overall efficiency and productivity for creators.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Client apps are often the first interaction users have with your services, whether those are cloud native intelligent apps, web-hosted backends or business data. They set the tone for user experience and can offer personalized interactions right from the start. With over 1.5 billion Windows devices worldwide, you have an opportunity to build beautiful, responsive and engaging user experiences that target these devices.

Regardless of whether you are a web developer or a native app developer, you likely want to reach the most client devices possible with great user experiences in the most efficient way possible. Developing great client apps helps you connect with users, scale your services and keep users coming back. To help you achieve these goals, Microsoft invests in a wide variety of client application frameworks and technologies for developers to build custom client experiences.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57152 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/clientinvestments1920-1024x517.png" alt="Chart showing Microsoft investments in client development" width="1024" height="517" />Microsoft is actively investing across all these areas for client development, which includes multiple technologies for building Windows native, Cross-platform, Hybrid and Web client apps. This post outlines the native client application frameworks for Windows that we are investing in and features some of the incredible work we‚Äôve been doing in those areas.
<h1>WinUI</h1>
WinUI, along with the two WinUI-based cross platform frameworks React Native for Desktop and .NET MAUI, are the three technologies we recommend for developing new applications that truly align with the Windows native experience.

WinUI enables developers to create fast and polished apps with the same rich set of modern UI controls and styles that powers key experiences in Windows. Its powerful toolkit has been refined in the most recent Windows App SDK 1.6 release, offering developers new performance improvements and control updates.

In WinAppSDK 1.6, WinUI adds Native Ahead-of-Time compilation support, one of the major new features in .NET development that results in apps with significantly reduced startup times and memory footprints.

[caption id="attachment_57148" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-57148 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Native-AOT-GIF-800-wide-1-loop.gif" alt="GIF of Bloom screensaver moving" width="800" height="291" /> Side-by-side comparison of Contoso Camera app launching with and without Native AOT[/caption]

In addition, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.tabview?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">TabView</a> control now features a new tab tear-out mode that lets users drag tabs out of a WinUI app just like they do in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, creating a new window and enabling snapping or maximizing in one smooth motion as they drag. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.pipspager?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">PipsPager</a> control also received a new wrapping mode, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.ratingcontrol?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">RatingControl</a> is now more customizable through theme resources.

As a sneak peek for what‚Äôs coming to WinUI in the upcoming Windows App SDK 1.7-experimental1 release, developers can look forward to the reintroduction of the highly anticipated TitleBar control with a fresh set of community-driven feedback improvements, as well as windowing enhancements and convenience APIs for controlling window size, remembering position and more.
<h1>React Native for Desktop</h1>
React Native lets you use your React and JavaScript skills and tools to create native applications that target iOS, Android, Windows (via WinAppSDK and WinUI), macOS, TVs and more. Over the last several years, Meta has been working towards enabling the ‚Äú<a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here">new architecture</a>‚Äù which includes new capabilities such as synchronous layout and effects, the concurrent renderer and better JS to native interfacing. At Microsoft, we‚Äôve partnered with Meta to bring the new architecture to Windows and macOS.

In <a href="https://aka.ms/reactnative">React Native for Desktop version 0.76</a> (Fall 2024), new apps can optionally <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-new-arch">opt into the new architecture</a> preview when creating new apps from the CLI. On Windows, the new architecture unlocks new capabilities like deep integration with the Windows App SDK (including the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/composition">Scene Graph</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/overview">Windows Copilot Library</a>), as well as support for Win32-based applications. v0.76 also provides a template for library authors to write modules that simultaneously target both the old and new architectures.

Although the new architecture <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-roadmap">is still in preview</a>, several of our key apps are validating the updated React Native for Desktop platform and are beginning to flight experiences on top of the new architecture. If you‚Äôre interested in seeing the capabilities of React Native for Desktop, <a href="https://Aka.ms/reactnativegalleryapp">you can download the React Native Gallery from the Microsoft Store</a>.

<h2><strong>Hyphen based ligature support in WPF</strong></h2>
Based on valuable feedback from the WPF community (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/109">Issue#109</a>), we‚Äôve addressed a longstanding issue with hyphen-based ligatures not working in WPF. This improvement is aimed at enhancing the developer experience by ensuring better text rendering and more polished typography in WPF applications.

<h1>WinForms (Windows Forms)</h1>
Windows Forms has long been a favorite technology for lightweight desktop applications built on Win32 APIs, particularly within the enterprise Line of Business space. Beloved for the ease of use, now the latest updates to WinForms allow developers to start leveraging modern technology in their existing applications. Over the course of .NET 9, WinForms has modernized thousands of lines of code to leverage modern C# capabilities. In response to operating system enhancements WinForms has added multi-select support for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.folderbrowserdialog?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">FolderBrowserDialog</a>, click-through capabilities to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.toolstrip?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">ToolStrip</a> control, and more than 100 new and updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">System.Drawing</a> APIs to leverage more GDI+ capabilities than before. In response to overwhelming demand, WinForms also added a Dark Mode detection feature (in experimental mode)!

For the first time, with .NET 9, developers are able to quickly and easily leverage the async capabilities of Windows and .NET. In this release, WinForms has introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.invokeasync?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">Control.InvokeAsync</a>. This new API allows WinForms applications to more easily leverage Web APIs, Semantic Kernel, AI and more! These enhancements ensure that WinForms remains a powerful and versatile tool for modern desktop application development, bridging the gap between legacy systems and the cutting-edge technology of today.
