										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today at the What's next for Windows — developer event, we'll show you the next era of Windows and how we are embracing Windows == open platform. This means everyone has open access to run the widest range of apps on Windows, enabling all developers to build the apps and experiences that empower users to create, learn, and play. We focus on five key areas of improvement for Windows 11:
<ul>
 	<li>The new Microsoft Store;</li>
 	<li>Improvements in end-to-end Web development;</li>
 	<li>New features coming for native Windows apps;</li>
 	<li>The Fluent design system and WinUI; and</li>
 	<li>What's new for game developers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking advantage of the new Microsoft Store</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56247" align="aligncenter" width="1600"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56247" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Hero_1600x600_1X.png" alt="" width="1600" height="600" /> <em>Image 1: The new Microsoft Store spotlight section on the homepage.</em>[/caption]

We unveil the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">new Microsoft Store on Windows</a>, and announce our support for more app types such as Win32, .NET, and PWAs, as well as support for Android apps from the Amazon Store. The Store is also redesigned to keep your customers in their flow and make it easier to search for and discover curated stories and collections. With new features like the "pop-up" Store your users can install apps directly from the browser. You will also have more revenue sharing options, such as keeping 100% when you bring your own commerce platform for the Store for your app (this does not include PC games). A preview of the new Store will be available soon to Windows Insiders.
<h3>Using our dev tools to improve Web and native Windows app development</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56243" align="aligncenter" width="1916"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56243" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Media-Progressive-Web-App-Shortcuts-integrated-with-Windows.png" alt="" width="1916" height="912" /> <em>Image 2: Progressive Web App Shortcuts integrated with Windows</em>[/caption]

With Windows 11, we are embracing all your apps and are working to make all apps feel right at home on Windows. And, with the new <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWABuilder3</a>, you can build a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/">PWA</a> from your web app in minutes. The evergreen <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> runtime is also included with Windows 11 making it easier to take advantage of its web platform as a performant and secure way to build hybrid web apps. Of course, you can continue to use powerful developer offerings like Windows Terminal and the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2021/04/devtools">Microsoft Edge DevTools</a> as they are now in-box.

The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK</a>, formerly known as Project Reunion, will make it easier for you to integrate Windows 11 features into your apps while still enabling you to reach more than 1B users on Windows 10. We will continue to build the Windows App SDK in cooperation with the community and starting today, you can use the Windows App SDK 0.8 Stable release (still called Project Reunion in the NuGet package and Visual Studio Marketplace). In this release you will find stability updates for WinUI3 and support for developing for Visual Studio 16.10. The Windows App SDK 1.0 will be released later this year.

You can also build apps that run natively on Windows on ARM with the new ARM64 Emulation Compatible tool. Using the ARM64EC, you can mix native ARM and emulated x64 code in the same process or module. This interoperability means you can optimize your app to run on Windows on ARM even if your app has x64 dependencies or loads x64 plugins you don't control.
<h3>Refreshing your apps and experiences so they are more engaging</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56244" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56244" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/D2-Design-Blog-Image.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /> <em>Image 3: Use UI with rounded geometry, leverage micro-interactions, and apply a refreshed color palette with new materials to make your apps look great in Windows 11. </em>[/caption]

If you want to rejuvenate your app design and experiences to feel at home on Windows 11, you can use WinUI3 to take advantage of the built-in UI update such as rounded geometry, refreshed iconography, new typography, fun micro-interactions (such as Lottie animation), and refreshed color palette. New materials like Mica also add meaningful hierarchy, and more. Snap layouts will also ensure you and your users will be productive on Windows 11.

You can also easily create and manage your app's windows using Reunion Windowing. It works with your existing app code, simplifies common operations, and brings new functionality to your desktop apps like light-dismiss behavior, picture-in-picture mode, and easier titlebar customization.
<h3>Developing awesome games for both PC and Console</h3>
To simplify game development for PCs, we are making our Game Development Kit (GDK) publicly available, free of charge <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/gdk">on GitHub</a>. The GDK contains the common tools, libraries, and documentation needed to build games for the PC and is the same base GDK used by thousands of developers today to deliver great experiences for players everywhere. The GDK adds to the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games">Game Stack</a> collection of technologies we offer today to help developers create, publish, monetize, and scale their games.

[caption id="attachment_56245" align="aligncenter" width="1306"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56245" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Auto-HDR-side-by-side.png" alt="" width="1306" height="550" /> <em>Image 4: Luminance heatmap showing SDR, Auto HDR and Native HDR</em>[/caption]

We also annnounce that great game play technology, previously only available on console, is now available on Windows 11 including DirectStorage. To get all the benefits of DirectStorage, you’ll need a PCIe 3.0+ NVMe SSD and a GPU that supports DirectX 12 and Shader Model 6.0+. This enables reduced load times and more expansive, detailed, living worlds. As well as Auto HDR, which automatically updates DirectX 11 and newer games with enhanced lighting and color to high dynamic range with no additional work needed by you or your players.

We look forward to collaborating with you to make progress on each of these efforts, so we can build productive, engaging, and immersive experiences together. Learn more at <a href="http://aka.ms/windowsdev">aka.ms/windowsdev</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust for Windows v0.9 has recently been released and includes full consumption support, along with several other updates! With completed consumption support, you can now call any Windows APIs (past, present, and future) using the Rust language projection. Rust developers have access to the entire Windows API surface in a language-idiomatic way, allowing them to easily take advantage of the power and breadth of Windows development. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this latest release, we have added new content to Microsoft Docs on </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing with Rust on Windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is also a new </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-oZrsCPKsn4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video for those who want to dive in! For more information on the project, check out the Rust for Windows </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Github repo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates and Improvements</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made great progress since last year’s </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust/WinRT public preview announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with continued improvements and investment in the project. Some of the changes and updates since this last announcement include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added support for Win32 and COM APIs, unifying the Windows APIs available for consumption via the </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate. The addition of these APIs is enabled by the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this increased coverage and unification of Windows APIs, we changed the name of the project from “Rust/WinRT” to “Rust for Windows”.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added several </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Rust for Windows repo, demonstrating how to call a wide range of Windows APIs (includes Win32, COM, and WinRT APIs).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate is published on crates.io and is now dual-licensed under MIT or Apache. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now uses generated bindings rather than hand-written bindings internally.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now builds on Linux.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many improvements and fixes for Win32 APIs, such as support for array types, a variety of string types, and updated metadata. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added more natural and idiomatic support for COM interfaces such as with return values, and support for additional APIs involving things like C-style unions and nested types. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved build times and error handling.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original API case is </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/pull/646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now preserved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will affect existing code using the windows crate.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformed QueryInterface-like functions into generic functions, making it safer and more convenient to call many COM-related functions.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more details and a more comprehensive list of updates, look at the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/docs/changelog.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changelog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Rust for Windows repo.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple example: Win32 APIs in Rust</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have recently added support for calling Win32 APIs in Rust, so I will walk through a simple example calling the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageBox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> function. First make sure you have your Rust development environment set up, which you can do by following </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these docs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The code for this example can also be found </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples/message_box"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, I created a new Rust project by running the following command in a command prompt: </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample&gt;cargo new message_box</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a new directory with the starter files for my Rust project. Navigate to this new directory, and create a nested bindings crate using the command below to house the generated bindings. By doing this, the build can cache the results of any imported bindings. </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample\message_box&gt;cargo new --lib bindings</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now opening my project in Visual Studio Code, the directory structure looks like this.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56204 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/05/rust1.png" alt="" width="452" height="578" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the outer Cargo.toml file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">message_box </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory, add the following dependency which tells Cargo that it now depends on the newly created bindings library.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
bindings = {path = "bindings"}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in the Cargo.toml file underneath the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folder, add the following dependencies to add the windows crate.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This will allow Cargo to download, build, and cache Windows support as a package.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"

[build-dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, in Visual Studio Code I created a new file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">folder named build.rs. In this file, use the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows::build</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> macro to specify the types that you want to use as shown below. You can list any additional APIs you want to use in this build script. The windows crate will then generate the necessary bindings directly from metadata.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">// build.rs
fn main() {
    windows::build!(
    Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::MessageBoxA
    );
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next in the lib.rs file under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings/src, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove the default code and add the following line, which includes the source code generated by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build.rs</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">windows::include_bindings!();
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the main.rs file, you can now make use of any of the specified Windows APIs. Paste the following code, which creates a message box with a “Hello World” message. Note that any Win32 functions and COM interface methods should be marked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsafe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">use bindings::Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::{MessageBoxA,  MESSAGEBOX_STYLE};
 
fn main() {
    unsafe {
        MessageBoxA(None, "Hello", "World", MESSAGEBOX_STYLE::MB_OK);
    }
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Run </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo build </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo run</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a command prompt from the root directory of the sample, and you will see the following output!</span>

<img class="wp-image-56208 size-full aligncenter" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/05/messagebox.png" alt="" width="266" height="296" />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56197" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/H2Q4w9xg_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />Daniel Paulino created his first Windows app when he was at a career crossroads: Was he good enough to have a successful career as a developer? He wasn’t sure, but Daniel also knew he needed a timer app that connected to his workout band. “At the time, no app did this. I had this curiosity. That drove me back into building apps,” Daniel says.

Daniel’s curiosity has served him well. Today, he is the creator of multiple Windows apps, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pillbox/9nblggh4x7vb">Pillbox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nightingale-rest-client/9n2t6f9f5zdn">Nightingale</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ambie-white-noise/9p07xnm5chp0">Ambie</a>. He is also a software engineer on the Windows apps team — and it’s safe to say Daniel is a Microsoft devices and tooling fanatic. “I’ve been around the block, but I keep coming back to Visual Studio, .NET, and WinUI. I’m addicted to Microsoft’s advanced set of tooling. It empowers me to take what’s in my brain and put it into an app.”

Looking at the many apps Daniel has released in the last five years, it would be easy to conclude his career path was straightforward — but from Daniel’s perspective, becoming a developer was more indirect: It came from following his passions.
<h3><strong>From a hobby to a career</strong></h3>
He was well into university before he considered software development as a career. Growing up, Daniel spent a lot of time in hospitals, watching doctors investigate both he and his mother’s medical issues. He became fascinated by the doctors’ curiosity and how they worked from interrogation and discovery to understand the root causes of disease.

This interest made Daniel plan to study Molecular Biology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver — until he had to take a course in Python. Daniel had always been drawn to computers, even though his family could not afford to buy a new one. Out of necessity, Daniel became the family expert at optimizing the operating system — he had even cleaned up the Windows OS registry on an old PC until it ran as well as the new devices his friends had.

Despite his passion for technology, Daniel never believed that his hobby could become a career — until that Python course, and after a guest speaker at his university asked him if he had ever heard of Bioinformatics. That moment changed the rest of his career: Daniel’s school offered a joint major program that fused his passions for medicine and immunology and his growing love for computer science. This discovery opened a new world.
<h3>Real-world problem solving</h3>
Looking back at his school experiences, Daniel is quick to recommend new developers build tools that solve real-world problems. He had a revelatory moment at his first bioinformatics job when his boss suggested that Daniel build the first-ever C++ tool that efficiently closed gaps in the human genome. The experience left an indelible mark: he was struck by how impactful his work could be.

Following this experience, Daniel applied and was accepted to a software engineering internship at Microsoft Garage. It was his first role exclusively as a developer. He and the four other interns on his team had four months to build their product, a Windows Phone app, from start to finish. While he learned a lot about collaboration, Daniel’s biggest takeaway was how much he needed to grow. Daniel recalls, “It was a very humbling experience. I wasn’t good enough at the time and that was hard to accept.” Daniel even considered removing computer science from his degree.

While he felt uncertain about what direction to take, Daniel turned to developing apps to solve real problems. “It was this passion and curiosity that reignited my interest in software. I didn’t actively stop myself from quitting, but I let myself be curious.”

<h3><strong>Empowering people with apps</strong></h3>
Daniel’s proudest achievement came from one of the apps he built during this time, Pillbox. The app tracks a user’s medication schedule and reminds users when to take their pills. He built it to help his mother keep track of her wide variety of medications.

His mother’s real-world challenge proved to be the perfect place for Daniel to put his app development skills to work. He was eager to help his mother and excited to learn about databases and notifications — two integral pieces of the app. Daniel’s mother also acted as his stakeholder, helping him make the app easier to use when she requested new features.

Developing Pillbox shaped how Daniel thinks about development: Not only had he learned how to work with a stakeholder, but he also got to see the impact the technology had on his mother. Even though she was far from a tech enthusiast, she could load all her information in the app, keep it up to date and easily share her information with her doctor.

What stuck with Daniel the most was how he was able to empower his mother. He says a defining moment came when “One day we went to the ER and the nurse asked if my mom took any medicines. When she showed them the app, the nurse was so excited and asked where she got it. My mom was able to say, ‘My son made it for me.’”

[caption id="attachment_56199" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-56199 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/DP_and_Mom-300x294.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="294" /> Daniel with his mom at his graduation from Simon Fraser University.[/caption]

Daniel recommends this kind of real-world problem-solving. “Be curious. Build software that empowers people. That will teach you a lot about yourself.”
<h3><strong>Pursuing growth opportunities</strong></h3>
Daniel continued to develop Windows apps after he graduated from university — while also starting a full-time job building bioinformatics tools. His development skills and enthusiasm for software development grew faster than ever, thanks to this cycle of developing both at work and home. Eventually, he hit a learning ceiling and Daniel realized that he needed to focus exclusively on development as a career.

<img class="alignleft wp-image-56200 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/1585425084522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />For anyone looking to make a similar switch, Daniel says, “Keep in touch with your network. In the long run, this can open up new opportunities when it’s time. Just learning from your network also helps you grow.”

Ultimately, Daniel ended up working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. While many of his friends assumed that working at Microsoft would be the end of his development efforts after hours, becoming a full-time developer made Daniel even more excited about development. “I continued coding on the bus and the train. The process of coding at work — and then coding at home — doubled my learning speed,” Daniel says. The skills he was learning at work made the apps he developed at home much better. In turn, that practice made him better at work.
<h3><strong>Following his curiosity today</strong></h3>
Throughout his career, Daniel keeps coming back to empowering others. “When I discovered software, I realized I was creative. My outlet was code,” he says. Once he had this outlet, he wanted to use it to help other people.

Amid the pandemic, Daniel created Ambie, a white noise app designed to help you focus, sleep or meditate. “What drives me is channeling my creativity to help someone, whether that’s to get something done with Nightingale or help them improve their health,” Daniel says.

“Developers have a unique opportunity to build something in their apartment that can affect a lot of people around the world. I just want to keep growing and helping more and more people that way.”]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">After many months of invigorating the Windows Community Toolkit with a multitude of improvements and features; we are happy to announce version 7.0 is available today! Made possible again with the support and contributions of our developer community</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">🎉</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you are new to the Toolkit, the Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helpers, extensions, and custom controls. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks for building UWP and .NET apps for Windows 10. The toolkit is part of the .NET Foundation. You can </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span data-contrast="none">download our Sample App</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> playground to discover and try Toolkit components before getting started on a project</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This new update includes a whole new .NET Standard MVVM library, easier to use Toast Notification helpers for both .NET and UWP, a completely revamped composition Animation system for C# &amp; XAML, new controls, and more!</span><span data-contrast="auto">!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This is one of the largest releases of the Toolkit ever as we embarked to optimize and streamline the Toolkit for the future. However, it also contains many breaking changes to pay attention to both around its underlying structure and code contracts. Please be sure to read </span><a href="https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/releases/tag/v7.0.0"><span data-contrast="none">our release notes here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, some high-level overviews are provided below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">There should be something for everyone in this release as it includes a wide variety of features; we hope you will enjoy them for building .NET and UWP apps on Windows 10.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">After discussions on the WinUI GitHub about revitalizing the ColorPicker control, the community stepped forward to envision a new experience for picking Colors. Robert developed a new version of </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/colorpicker"><span data-contrast="none">ColorPicker</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for everyone to use and try.

<span data-contrast="auto">In a few weeks, we will release an updated version of our WinUI 3 based controls to NuGet for Project Reunion 0.5. As part of this change, we’ll also be starting to use a new package identity root of </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">CommunityToolkit.*</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> for our packages. Our existing UWP packages will remain as </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.*</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">; however, our new packages for WinUI will be under </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">CommunityToolkit.WinUI.*</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Our plan will be to deprecate the UWP packages at a time in the future when we feel our community as a whole can migrate to WinUI 3 when it supports the features our existing UWP community knows and loves today. Until that time, we will plan to support our existing UWP developers first via our existing packages built on top of UWP + WinUI 2.x and ship parallel versions for WinUI 3. Therefore, each next toolkit release for UWP (e.g. 7.1) will have a corresponding version 7.1 which contains the same feature set but for WinUI 3 (outside of anything not currently supportable on WinUI 3 yet).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In every one of the billion Windows 10 devices worldwide, there is a GPU for accelerating your AI tasks. From photo editing applications enabling new user experiences through AI to tools that help you train machine learning models for your applications with little effort, DirectML accelerates these experiences by leveraging the computing power of any DirectX 12 GPU. Over a hundred applications already take advantage of DirectML—with over two hundred million hardware accelerated inferences performed daily on Windows. To make it even easier for applications to take advantage of DirectML, we are excited to announce the public release of DirectML as a standalone API for Win32, UWP, and WSL applications in a single NuGet package, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/">Microsoft.AI.DirectML</a>. Let's look at a few ways DirectML is used today and spark ideas for your own applications.

Healthcare is another field leveraging machine learning techniques in interesting ways. Consider a sonographer using an ultrasound device to evaluate fetal brain development during their patient’s pregnancy. Acquiring the required planes and taking the required measurements for this is challenging because it requires lots of manual input from the sonographer. This is where GE Healthcare’s Voluson™ Ultrasound Devices comes in handy: pre-trained neural networks help the sonographer using the ultrasound probe automatically segment specific imaging planes from a volume and perform manual measurements. Previously identifying the approriate planes and measurements required time consuming manual adjustments. GE Healthcare relies on Windows ML and DirectML for delivering consistent and reliable results across a broad range of their ultrasound devices.

An exciting area of growth is at the intersection of machine learning and real-time graphics in video games where performance is critical. Early applications in this area include using neural networks for superior image upscaling and filling in the sampling gaps of ray-traced images; these techniques are making it possible to present high-resolution gameplay without the cost of high-resolution rendering. The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectMLSuperResolution">DirectML Super Resolution sample</a> showcases how DirectML can integrate seamlessly with these real-time graphics intensive applications.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and new applications like these are introduced every day: models are used for transcribing audio, translating hand-written notes into text, fault detection in manufacturing, and many more! DirectML has provided the hardware acceleration support needed for these scenarios since Windows 10 version 1903. Now the DirectML NuGet package offers our latest hardware acceleration investments even sooner to framework and application developers. If your model is representable using the ONNX format, then you too can tap into DirectML.
<h2>Training Models with TensorFlow and Lobe</h2>
Accelerating inference is where DirectML started: supporting training workloads across the breadth of GPUs in the Windows ecosystem is the next step. In September 2020, we <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/09/08/open-sourcing-tensorflow-with-directml/">open sourced TensorFlow with DirectML</a> to bring cross-vendor acceleration to the popular TensorFlow framework. This project is all about enabling rapid experimentation and training on your PC, regardless of which GPU you have on your device, with a simple and painless setup process. We also know many machine learning developers depend on tools, libraries, and containerized workloads that only work with Unix-like operating systems, so DirectML runs in both Windows <em>and</em> the Windows Subsystem for Linux. DirectML makes it easy for you to work with the environment and GPU you already have.

Machine learning is also becoming increasingly accessible with tools like <a href="https://www.lobe.ai/">Lobe</a> – an easy to use app that has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. To get started, collect and label your images and Lobe will automatically train a custom machine learning model for you. On Windows, Lobe uses DirectML to deliver great performance across a wide range of GPUs. When training is done, you can try out your model and ship it to any platform you choose.
