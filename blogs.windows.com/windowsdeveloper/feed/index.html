										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Babylon.js is powered and supported by one of the most incredible open source communities in the world. Over 500 people from across the globe have contributed to making it one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple, and open web rendering engines out there. With Babylon.js 7.0, this community continues to shine bright, by adding some incredible new features and extensions to this passionately shared and nurtured platform.
<h3><strong>The Greased Line</strong></h3>
Built right into the core engine, the new Greased Line system unlocks some exciting new possibilities for web creators. This new special type of line is built using the mesh system to display lines of any specified width. The extra sprinkling of non-trademarked fantasy dust is that these lines are equipped with a special shader that allows the line to always face the camera so they can be viewed consistently no matter where the camera moves to.

<h3><strong>Advanced Ground Projection</strong></h3>
This one is honestly just too cool to put into words, but we’ll do our best. Imagine taking a 360 skybox/environment and then magically transforming the lower half into a “fake” ground that seems to support the 3D objects in your scene. This illusion provides a perfectly smooth transition from the ground to the sky within your scene. Sound like wizardry? Well what are you waiting for? Check it out!

<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Seamless Texture Decals</strong></h3>
Introduced with Babylon.js 6.0, texture decals offered a powerful new option of projecting images onto an existing texture of a 3D object in your scene. With Babylon.js 7.0, that same system is given superpowers by allowing the decals to seamlessly map across UV boundaries! That means that no matter how pretty or less-pretty your UV layout might be, decals will work perfectly on any 3D object!

<h3><strong>MMD Support Community Extension</strong></h3>
This exciting extension to Babylon.js 7.0 offers creators the ability to import 3D assets and animations from the popular 3D Creation Software: <a href="https://mikumikudance.en.softonic.com/">MikuMikuDance</a> or MMD for short. In addition to loading assets and animations, it also has support for IK solvers, a morph system, synced audio playback, player controls, and much much more.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our mission is to build one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple, and open web rendering engines in the world, and we are excited to announce that mission takes another step forward today, with Babylon.js 7.0.

https://youtu.be/5V07vm5u74Q

Babylon.js 7.0 is a <a href="https://aka.ms/bayblon7Celebration">celebration</a> of a year’s worth of new features, optimizations, and performance improvements that unlock new capabilities for web developers everywhere.

So, let’s dive in and see what new goodness awaits you.
<h3><strong>Procedural Geometry (Node Geometry)</strong></h3>
We are absolutely thrilled to announce that Babylon.js now features procedural geometry. We call it “Node Geometry.” An advanced system that allows you to create procedural geometry using a non-destructive node tree system.

If you’re already familiar with Babylon’s <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/node_material">Node Material</a> and the <a href="https://nme.babylonjs.com/">Node Material Editor (NME)</a>, then you’ll feel right at home in the <a href="https://nge.babylonjs.com/">Node Geometry Editor</a>. This simple to use tool lets you assemble a non-destructive geometry tree, allowing you to create anything from tiny geometric variations to entire procedural worlds/landscapes.

Procedural geometry offers the ability to create complex geometry at run/build time. This means that the end-user doesn’t have to download large 3D assets. Instead, the local machines/devices can use the CPU to create those assets. This means rather than requiring your web visitors to download hundreds of MBs worth of 3D assets, they can instead download a few KBs worth of Node Geometry data and allow their own machine to create the geometry. This adds a tremendous layer of flexibility for creators to offer the perfect loading/performance optimization for their unique web experience!

There’s really no better way to experience all that Node Geometry will offer other than for you to dive in and try it out yourself!

Try it out yourself: <a href="https://nge.babylonjs.com/">Node Geometry Editor</a>

<h3><strong>Global Illumination</strong></h3>
Empowering web creators to conjure up more beautiful and immersive experiences is a foundational part of the Babylon Mission. With Babylon.js 7.0, we are excited to introduce support for basic Global Illumination. This highly desired and advanced feature allows Babylon.js scenes to render even more lifelike experiences by allowing light and shadows to “bounce” around environments in a way that much closer matches reality.

Global Illumination represents a major advancement in web rendering and, just like everything that comes with Babylon.js 7.0, is completely free and open source. To truly appreciate the beauty this adds to scenes, you just need to check it out.

https://youtu.be/r0QteNkE88s
<h3><strong>Gaussian Splat Rendering</strong></h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting">Gaussian Splatting</a> is a new technique to capture and display volumetric data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_radiance_field">Neural Radiance Fields</a>, point clouds and billboards. In more simple terms, it’s an advanced way of allowing people to capture and display the real world with a level of unmatched visual fidelity and performance.

Babylon.js 7.0 adds support for rendering Gaussian Splats on the web, across all devices, running at 60 fps!

Try it out: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon7GSplatDemo">https://aka.ms/babylon7GSplatDemo</a>

Learn more here: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon7GSplatDoc">https://aka.ms/babylon7GSplatDoc</a>

https://youtu.be/JuNfLFPc7Ok
<h3><strong>Ragdoll Physics</strong></h3>
Babylon.js 7.0 builds on the momentum (see what we did there?) of Havok physics support in Babylon, by adding support for ragdoll animation. This allows any skeletal rigged asset to collapse and flop around with limp lifelessness at the push of a button. What are you waiting for? Try it out!

Try it here: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon7RagdollDemo">https://aka.ms/babylon7RagdollDemo</a>

Learn more here: <a href="https://aka.ms/babylon7RagdollDoc">https://aka.ms/babylon7RagdollDoc</a>

https://youtu.be/w1eR7IYqDWY

Those are just some of the main features of Babylon.js 7.0, there is much more! Tune in for next posts and learn more about WebXR, glTF and animation advancements, up to the incredible contributions from the community.<strong>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">Sandboxing Python can be very useful for developers but has been challenging due to the flexibility of CPython implementation. It is particularly useful in many scenarios to have sandboxed Python.  For example, on any website that needs to execute arbitrary code from users, like coding practice sites or online interpreters. It could also be useful to help prevent increasing attacks on LLMs (Large Language Models).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Win32 App Isolation (https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation) lights up a different path to sandboxing Python – not on a Python library level, but on an application/OS level.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Win32 App Isolation is designed to isolate Win32 application by creating a security boundary between the application and the OS, using the combination of AppContainer, virtualized resources and brokering file system, which helps to prevent the application from compromising the operating system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Following are the specifics requirements and guidance for sandboxing</span> <span data-contrast="auto">CPython with Win32 App Isolation on recent Windows Insider releases. It takes about 30-60 minutes and anyone with the insider version of Windows can do it on their local machine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">To use Win32 App Isolation, you need the insider version of Windows with version number &gt; 25357, and the MSIX Packaging Tool from https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/releases/</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step One:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Download the Python installer for Windows from python.org. 3.12.2 was used for this specific example.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step Two:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Package it by following the documentation (</span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/packaging/msix-packaging-tool.md"><span data-contrast="none">https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/packaging/msix-packaging-tool.md</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">). You may need a certificate to sign the package to install it (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/create-app-package#signing-preference).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Add <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">isolatedWin32-PromptForAccess </code></span><span data-contrast="auto">capability for demonstration purposes, so you can allow it to access certain resources in prompts. Without the capability, all access to the user files that are not explicitly set to be available to the application would be denied.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Add an alias <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">python3.12.exe </code></span><span data-contrast="auto">to use it from PowerShell.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step Three:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Install the package. Use the defined alias <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">python3.12.exe</code> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in PowerShell to bring up the Python interpreter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">When starting the Python interpreter, it will prompt you to ask permission to the current working directory. Python itself would be brought up with either option – but this determines whether Python has access to the files in the current directory.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">For example, if you clicked “No” here, you would not be able to list the files in the current directory anymore:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The selection will be remembered so the application will only prompt once for any file/folder. The user can reset the file permissions in Settings – Privacy &amp; security – File system:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The Python interpreter should work well on its own given no code has been changed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">From the examples above, by introducing Win32 App Isolation you can help prevent Python from accessing the file system and the network without consent.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">There are two obvious questions:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>
<ol>
 	<li>How can you “click” the prompts if you want to deploy this on your server? As mentioned above, <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">isolatedWin32-promptForAccess</code>is only added for demonstration purposes, and it is not needed for isolation. Without it, your system would simply deny any access to user files, thus helping to prevent attacks like ransomware.</li>
 	<li>Then how can you grant access to the application for required files like modules, scripts, and data? There are several ways to do it:<span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>
<ul>
 	<li>You can package the modules you need into your app, then they will be accessible by default.</li>
 	<li>You can put the file you need access to into the app’s profile in <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">%localappdata%</code> where the app is granted access automatically.</li>
 	<li>You can put the file to a “publisher directory”, which is any directory with a name ending with your app’s publisher ID in <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">c:\ProgramData</code>. (<a style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px); background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/fundamentals/consent.md"><span data-contrast="none">win32-app-isolation/docs/fundamentals/consent.md at main · microsoft/win32-app-isolation (github.com)</span></a><span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);" data-contrast="auto">)</span></li>
 	<li>You can set the access of files and directories with icalcs to allow your app or all apps to access them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<span data-contrast="auto">With the technology, the users can create much lighter solutions when they try to execute code from an untrusted source. Isolated Python can live in parallel with normal Python and perform as a low-privilege interpreter on the side. Or, with correct configuration, it can be used on its own which could help protect the system from being compromised while keeping all the functionalities from Python.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Intel®, one of our key partners, to bring the first Neural Processing Unit (NPU) powered by DirectML on Windows. AI is transforming the world, driving innovation and creating value across industries. NPUs are critical components in enabling amazing AI experiences for developers and consumers alike.

An NPU is a processor built for enabling machine learning (ML) workloads that are computationally intensive, do not require graphics interactions, and provide efficient power consumption. These new devices will revolutionize how AI transforms our day-to-day experiences. We are excited to share that early next year we will release the DirectML support for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors with Intel® AI Boost, the new integrated NPU.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56912 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/12/DML-1-224x300.png" alt="DirectML Platform overview" width="224" height="300" />DirectML is a low-level, hardware abstracted API that provides direct access to hardware capabilities of modern devices, such as GPUs, for ML workloads. It is part of the DirectX family—the Windows graphics and gaming platform—and is designed to integrate with other DirectX components, such as DirectX12. DirectML integrates with popular ML and tooling frameworks, such as the cross-platform inference engine, the ONNX Runtime and Olive, the Windows optimization tooling framework for ML models, thus simplifying the development and deployment of AI experiences across the Windows ecosystem.

By extending the hardware acceleration capabilities to include NPU support in DirectML, we are opening new possibilities for AI on Windows. DirectML with NPU support will be in developer preview in early 2024, along with the latest ONNX Runtime release, with broadening support over 2024. Stay tuned for more announcements with key partners, expanded capabilities and how to use DirectML for NPUs.

We can't wait to see the amazing AI experiences you will create on Windows, with DirectML on Intel® Core™ Ultra processors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep learning architectures that generate high quality synthetic images of people, animals or objects. These networks have enabled developers to provide text-based prompts for generating realistic images, modifying existing images and completing missing information in training datasets.

Head over to the <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2023/11/29/exploring-draggan-implementation-using-onnx-runtime/">Microsoft Open Source Blog</a> to learn about DragGAN, a type of GAN designed to update generated images with finer control over details and expressions. DragGAN enables minor tweaks to StyleGAN generated images without recreating the images again, resulting in efficient high quality image generation. The blog post describes the authors’ implementation of the DragGAN algorithm using ONNX Runtime. It also provides a C# example for integrating the DragGAN model into a native Windows application.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the latest Windows 11 update on Sept. 26 we released a host of developer features as the core component of the Windows OS with an intent to make every developer more productive on Windows. Today we are excited to announce Windows AI Studio, a new AI experience to help enterprises and developers jumpstart local AI development and deployment on Windows, along with new updates to Dev Home and new enterprise features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that enhance security and simplify deployment.
<h3><strong>Windows AI Studio simplifies generative AI app development</strong></h3>
Many developers and enterprises want to bring AI differentiated experiences to their apps and we have heard from these developers that they need an easier and trusted way to get started with local AI development. With many tools, frameworks and open-source models available it is difficult to pick the right set of tools to test, fine-tune and optimize the models or select the most trusted models that best fit diverse business needs. That’s why we are thrilled to announce Windows AI Studio, a new experience for developers, that extends the tooling of Azure AI Studio to jumpstart AI development locally on Windows.
<h3><strong>Getting started with AI development locally on Windows is easier and faster than ever</strong></h3>
<a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio</a> simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from Azure AI Studio and other catalogs like Hugging Face, enabling developers to fine-tune, customize and deploy state-of-the-art small language models, or SLMs, for local use in their Windows apps. This includes an e2e guided workspace setup that includes model configuration UI and guided walkthroughs to fine-tune popular SLMs like Phi. Developers can then rapidly test their fine-tuned model using the Prompt Flow and Gradio templates integrated into the workspace.

Windows AI Studio brings us closer to supporting Hybrid Loop development patterns and enabling hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. This gives developers greater choice either to run their models on the cloud on Azure or on the edge locally on Windows (or across the two) to meet their needs. Prompt Flow makes it easier than ever to implement this hybrid pattern by switching between local SLMs and cloud LLMs.

The picture above shows a typical fine-tuning workflow. Developers will bring their own datasets for fine-tuning. See our fine-tuning guide for details on how to get started. Note that the fine-tuning + model evaluation steps will be iterative until the model meets the developers’ evaluation criteria.

In the coming weeks developers can access <a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio as a VS Code Extension</a>, a familiar and seamless interface to help you get started with AI development. The guided interface allows you to focus on what you do best, coding, while we do all the heavy lifting by setting your developer environment with all the tools needed. <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/ai">Learn more</a> about Windows AI Studio.

<h3><strong>Windows optimized state-of-the-art models</strong></h3>
In addition to fine-tuning capabilities, Windows AI Studio will also highlight state-of-the-art (SOTA) models optimized specifically for Windows GPUs and NPUs in the future, starting with Llama 2-7B, Mistral-7B, Falcon-7B, and Stable Diffusion XL. Earlier this year, we talked about how ONNX Runtime is the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/unlocking-the-end-to-end-windows-ai-developer-experience-using-onnx-runtime-and-olive/">gateway to Windows AI</a>. DirectML is the native Windows machine learning API, and together they give developers access to a simplified yet highly performant AI development experience. With <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models, developers can ensure that their models run as performantly as possible with the DirectML+ONNX Runtime combo.

At Inspire this year we shared details on how developers will be able to run Llama 2 with <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">DirectML and the ONNX Runtime</a> and we have been hard at work to make this a reality. We now have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">sample</a> showing our progress with Llama 2 7B; after an Olive optimization pass, our sample shows how developers can now run this versatile LLM locally and performantly on varied Windows hardware. We're excited about this milestone, and this is only a first peek. Stay tuned for future enhancements to support even larger models, fine-tuning and lower-precision data types.  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56883">Learn more.</a>

<strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) </strong>offers a robust platform for AI development on Windows by making it easy to run Windows and Linux workloads simultaneously. Developers can easily share files, GUI apps, GPU and more between environments with no additional setup. WSL is now enhanced to meet the enterprise grade security requirements so enterprise customers can confidently deploy WSL for their developers to take advantage of both Windows and Linux operating systems on the same Windows device and accelerate AI development efficiently.
<h3><strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux now offers new enterprise features that enhance security and simplify deployment </strong></h3>
It’s now easier than ever to securely deploy WSL to your company with the latest enterprise features. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint released a new plug-in for WSL that enables security teams to continuously monitor events in all running distributions – delivering unparalleled visibility into systems once considered a critical blind spot.</li>
 	<li>Access to WSL and its key security settings are now controllable with Intune. Admins can configure access to WSL entirely, or dive into access to specific security settings like custom kernel, nested virtualization and more, to ensure security while using WSL.</li>
 	<li>Advanced networking controls in WSL let you specify firewall rules that apply to the WSL virtual machine and improve network compatibility in complex enterprise environments. <a href="https://aka.ms/wslenterpriseblogpost">Learn more</a> to get started with WSL today!</li>
</ul>
We want to ensure Windows is optimized for developers and helps you be productive across any development you do – desktop, web, AI or cross-platform. That’s why we introduced Dev Home, your ultimate productivity companion, at Build 2023. Dev Home is a new experience for developers on Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools such as GitHub. Today, Dev Home is getting even better for you.
<h3><strong>Dev Home now has Azure DevOps extension so you can stay on top of your daily tasks</strong></h3>
We are thrilled to release Dev Home v0.7 with Azure DevOps (ADO) support powered by the new Dev Home Azure extension. This extension allows you to easily clone your Azure repositories using Dev Home to get your machine to a code-ready state, manage your ADO projects and get productive right away from the Windows desktop. Additionally, you can pin ADO widgets to display query results and query tiles to provide easily glanceable information for the projects you care about most. Enterprises can take advantage of Dev Home to onboard new team members and projects faster and developers can stay on top of projects, queries and relevant tasks from Dev Home.

With our focus on empowering every developer to be an AI developer and continued investments on developer productivity, we believe Windows now provides the best platform for you to jumpstart local AI development and create cutting edge experiences for your customers. We are humbled and excited to be on this journey with you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[At Inspire this year we <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">talked</a> about how developers will be able to run Llama 2 on Windows with DirectML and the ONNX Runtime and we've been hard at work to make this a reality.

We now have a sample showing our progress with Llama 2 7B!

See <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2</a>

This sample relies on first doing an optimization pass on the model with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models. Olive utilizes powerful graph fusion optimizations from ONNX Runtime and a model architecture optimized for DirectML to speed up inference times by up to <strong>10X</strong>!

After this optimization pass, Llama 2 7B runs fast enough that you can have a conversation in real time on multiple vendors’ hardware!

We’ve also built a little UI to make it easy to see the optimized model in action.

Thank you to our hardware partners who helped make this happen. For more on how Llama 2 lights up on our partners’ hardware with DirectML see:
