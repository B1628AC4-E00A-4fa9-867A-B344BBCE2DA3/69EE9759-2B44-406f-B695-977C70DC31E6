										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Developing for Windows 11</h2>
Windows 11 was built to unlock the full power of the PC. This new operating system empowers you to deliver new and innovative apps, grow your business how you choose, and makes developing on Windows easier by allowing you to use the tools and frameworks you already use and know. Windows 11 is our most open platform yet and it gives you the ability to build and run the widest range of apps. We can’t wait to see what you build for your users to learn, create, and play. Here are the key updates you should know about:
<ul>
 	<li>The new Microsoft Store;</li>
 	<li>Advancements and updates for web and native development; and</li>
 	<li>Updates to our Fluent design system</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Grow your business with the new Microsoft Store</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56401 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/Picture1.png" alt="" width="1430" height="959" /></strong></h3>
<em>Image 1: The new Microsoft Store </em>

The <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176287">new Microsoft Store</a> is more open and allows you and your customers to be more productive and easily find the best apps. The new <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">Store focuses on openness, fairness, and innovation</a>. This means more apps are available in the store without having to update business models or re-write apps; more apps are discoverable due to updated policies that allow standalone digital storefront apps to be found via search, and to encourage innovation we’re enabling you to bring your own browser engine so you can innovate how you chose. This is the start of our journey, and we hope you’ll continue to engage with us so we can continue to provide access to broader markets and opportunities.
<h3><strong>Streamline your Web and native app development </strong></h3>
Windows 11 was built with developers in mind – to create a platform that provides a seamless development experience no matter what app you are building. We continue to learn from our past and understand vision, innovation, and creativity can truly thrive when tools, features, and experiences are easy to use. That’s why we’ve taken steps to make developing on Windows easier.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56398 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/image1.png" alt="" width="1356" height="495" />

<span class="TextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0">Image 2: Microsoft Edge DevTools in a variety of color</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0"> themes</span></em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0"><em>.</em> </span></span><span class="EOP SCXW187909126 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> is now part of the operating system for everyone. We’ve significantly improved performance and reduced the disk footprint, memory usage, and launch time of your WebView2 apps by hard linking with the Edge browser. And, for those of you building Progressive Web Apps, we’ve improved the desktop integration and user experience with new standards-based and experimental capabilities. You can now integrate your apps more seamlessly with the desktop by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#window-controls-overlay-for-installed-desktop-web-apps">customizing the titlebar</a>, registering as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#uri-protocol-handling">default handler for links</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#uri-protocol-handling">protocols</a>, and even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#file-handling">handling files on the user’s filesystem</a>. Of course, you can continue to use offerings like Windows Terminal and our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/09/14/edge-devtools-93-personalization/">Microsoft Edge DevTools</a> themes to match the visual experience found throughout Windows 11.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Windows App SDK</a> and WinUI 3 represent the latest in native app development for Windows 11, and they empower you to build the most productive desktop apps in the world. The Windows App SDK 1.0 Preview 1 brings many new developments, including support for the MSAL library, AppInstance APIs for handling and redirecting activation, AppWindow APIs for managing your window regardless of what UI stack you’re using, performance and reliability improvements, and much more.

With Windows 11, we’ve made it easier for you to run your apps on Windows on ARM.  You can run your unmodified x64 apps using emulation, or you can compile your apps natively for ARM64 for the best possible performance on these devices. Windows 11 on ARM also introduces the new <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fuwp%2Fporting%2Farm64ec&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjanlee%40microsoft.com%7C104f513901764c70c05508d9844d05a7%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637686288610944463%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=2nFPVkfzA3c9Jt7Ad9Oby2jxzowlmEzeqk7lJpBLqEY%3D&amp;reserved=0">ARM64 Emulation C</a>ompatible ABI which enables you to build apps that can contain or load both ARM64EC and x64 code, allowing you to incrementally migrate existing x64 apps to run natively on ARM64 over time.
<h3><strong>Refresh your apps and experiences </strong></h3>
Windows 11 is the first major <a href="https://aka.ms/windows11design">redesign of Windows</a> and we did it to bring the operating system closer to the ecosystem of products that are being created at Microsoft.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56399 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/image2.gif" alt="" width="624" height="351" />

<em><span class="TextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">Image </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">3</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">: </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">Microsoft Fluent Design</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0"> showing examples of </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">rounded geometry, </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">acrylic, mica, and our new typography and iconography.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW159786446 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></em>

Windows 11 feels more modern and beautiful. The subtle change of rounding our geometry across all of the UI surfaces makes Windows feel more approachable and your apps easier to scan, which helps your customers stay more engaged. Some of the visual updates in Windows 11 will be inherited by apps with no additional code changes, but to benefit from all these visual updates, some work will be required. We recommend you focus on three areas:
<ul>
 	<li>Use UI with rounded geometry. This can be applied to both the non-client area and to the client area of the app.</li>
 	<li>Apply the refreshed color palette and materials. The new color palette is applied automatically to our latest WinUI controls (WinUI 2.6 or greater required), apps that use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/acrylic">acrylic</a> can switch to the latest brush, and our new material <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/mica">Mica</a> lets the wallpaper image shine through the frame of your app.</li>
 	<li>Update to our typography and iconography. Windows 11 delivers two new system icons. To incorporate the evolved Segoe UI, you need WinUI 2.6 (or greater), and your controls will automatically inherit the latest font family. To use the Segoe Variable UI, you should point to “Segoe UI Variable” in any instance that references “Segoe UI”.</li>
</ul>
Windows 11 is the next generation of Windows, and the entire experience was reimagined with you and your users in mind. We wanted a platform that would feel like home – centered on you but with more openness and security. We can’t wait to see what you build.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In June, we <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">introduced the new Microsoft Store</a> on Windows, redesigned from the ground up to meet the needs of customers across a variety of app experiences. We also opened up the Microsoft Store on Windows to developers using different types of frameworks, packaging technologies, and commerce platforms – in alignment with <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/">our commitment to choice, fairness, and innovation</a>.

The new Microsoft Store will launch to the public alongside Windows 11 on October 5<sup>th</sup>. It will also be available to Windows 10 customers in the coming months.

As we continue our journey, we are grateful for the response from the app developer ecosystem, and we will continue to listen to their feedback. Today, we would like to recognize some of the new apps that are now available in the Microsoft Store and share some updates to our policies for third-party stores.
<h3><strong>Opening to more apps</strong></h3>
Developers told us they love not having to re-write their existing desktop apps or change their business models in order to be part of the Microsoft Store on Windows. Since June, hundreds of app developers have <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blogsourcenewstore">registered</a> to our preview program to bring their desktop apps onboard. An initial wave of new desktop apps that you can try today on the Windows 11 Insider Preview includes communication platforms like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDC2RH70K22MN">Discord</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP99J3KP4XZ4VV">Zoom Cloud Meetings</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9K178L5G0JQ0">KakaoTalk</a>, and creativity-focused tools such as <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9mwxf9hmhzrz">Luminar AI</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9MFVKXKKTD8M" data-wplink-url-error="true">Music Maker</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDDTKMZ5N9Q41">VLC</a>. Desktop productivity applications, like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDM17HK323C4X">TeamViewer</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDP273C0XHQH2">Adobe Acrobat Reader DC,</a> and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9MWJQ9TX63F9">LibreOffice</a>, are also available for download and are joined by new additions from inside Microsoft, like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP89DCGQ3K6VLD">Microsoft PowerToys</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q">Visual Studio Code</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP8CDJNZKFM06W">Visual Studio Community</a>.

Furthermore, several high-quality Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are also now available in the Microsoft Store on Windows, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NS3RBQ5HV5F">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFHWM4">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/tiktok/9nh2gph4jzs4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJKS5V4V997">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PLHCT3922NQ">Quizlet</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NTDQP5CQG07">Tumblr</a>. PWAs on Windows allow developers to <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">bring the best of their web experiences</a> even closer to their customers, for example by easy access in the taskbar or Start menu, icon notification badging, or matching the user preference on light/dark theme mode. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/clipchamp-the-best-free-video-editor-for-creators-sales-and-marketing/9p1j8s7ccwwt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Clipchamp</a>, available for free on the Microsoft Store, is a video editor with a deep feature set and seamless web-sharing workflow. Now part of the Microsoft family, Clipchamp is a great example of what Windows developers can deliver using PWA as a foundation.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56396 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/PDP_wipe_09-28-21_alt_1920x1080_latest.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" />
<h3><strong>Opening to other stores</strong></h3>
Our commitment to being an ‘open Store for an open platform’ isn’t just about the various technical underpinnings of how apps are built. It’s also about making sure our business terms are fair and help promote innovation. For instance, the Microsoft Store on Windows no longer requires app developers to share revenue with Microsoft, when apps manage their own in-app payment systems.

In that spirit, today we’re <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies?redirectedfrom=MSDN">announcing another significant update to our Microsoft Store on Windows policies</a>, which will allow third-party storefront apps to be discoverable in the Microsoft Store on Windows. Just like any other app, third-party storefront apps will have a product detail page that can be found via search or by browsing – so that users can easily find and install it with the same confidence as any other app in the Microsoft Store on Windows. Today, we are sharing that Amazon and Epic Games will bring their storefront apps to the Microsoft Store over the next few months, and we look forward to welcoming other stores as well in the future.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56388 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image2-1.png" alt="" width="1429" height="804" />

<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">As we shared back in August</a>, we’re excited about the journey we’re on to bring Android apps and games to Windows 11, including the ability to discover and search the Amazon Appstore catalog directly in the Microsoft Store. This will start as a preview for Windows Insiders soon; we will share soon more details about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications">system requirements</a> and market availability of the preview experience, and we look forward to the engagement and feedback with the Windows Insiders community.
<h3><strong>Opening to other browsers</strong></h3>
In June, we updated our policies for browser apps, enabling developers to bring their own browser engines (instead of relying on the OS’ web platform) and continue to innovate with their user experience. Today we are welcoming two browsers, joining Microsoft Edge in the Microsoft Store on Windows: Opera and Yandex Browser.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56391 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/Opera_PDP_4.6_G3.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2178" />
<h3><strong>Opening to your apps</strong></h3>
Our journey has just started, and we look forward to continuing to work together with the developer ecosystem to deliver even more great experiences for the Microsoft Store on Windows. You can learn <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blogsourcenewstore">how to publish your app to the new Microsoft Store on Windows here,</a> as well as catch the latest docs and best practices to reach new customers.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Announcing Windows Community Toolkit v7.1</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Windows Community Toolkit has another update filled with improvements and features! We’re thrilled to announce version 7.1 is available today! Made possible again with the support and contributions of our developer community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎉</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are new to the Toolkit, the Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helpers, extensions, and custom controls. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks for building UWP and .NET apps for Windows. The toolkit is part of the .NET Foundation. You can </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">download our Sample App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> playground to discover and try Toolkit components before getting started on a project.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This update includes authentication helpers, Microsoft Graph controls, the easiest way to add Shadows to your app in XAML, a new RichSuggestBox control, and more! We even have a preview of source generator support for our MVVM Toolkit library.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve had a lot of exciting news this year too.

See more details of these changes and new features below.</span>
<h3><strong>Microsoft Identity Authentication Helpers, OneDrive Storage, and Microsoft Graph Controls - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/shweaver-MSFT">Shane Weaver</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New and improved for 7.1, our Microsoft Graph offering is moving out of its prior preview phase and has been overhauled and streamlined with new helpers and providers for authenticating with Microsoft Identity and calling Graph APIs. We received a lot of great feedback from the community that we hope will help devs hit the ground running, authenticating users, and calling </span><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Graph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> APIs!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56359 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image3.png" alt="" width="1425" height="831" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, be sure to check out our full </span><a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Sample-Graph-ContosoNotes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ContosoNotes sample</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which shows how these APIs can be leveraged and create a great experience for users across their applications and devices.</span>
<h3><strong>Authentication Providers </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this release we are introducing a variety of new authentication packages:</span>
<table style="height: 258px;" width="1230">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Package</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core constructs for supporting authentication aware applications.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication.Msal</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication provider based on the official Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET SDK.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication.Uwp</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication provider based on the native account management APIs in Windows.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MsalProvider available in the *.Msal package is .NET Standard 2.0 and works across multiple systems. This provider is better for supporting cross-platform or complex authentication scenarios. For UWP apps, try the WindowsProvider for a lighter-weight package.</span>
<h3><strong>Graph Powered Controls and OneDrive Helpers</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we are re-introducing our Graph controls and helpers in the form of two new packages:</span>
<table style="height: 201px;" width="1012">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Package</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Graph</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensions and helpers for making adhoc Graph requests, leveraging the official Graph SDK for .NET.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Graph.Uwp</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows specific helpers and controls for facilitating authentication flow and visualizing Graph data.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The *.Graph package includes Graph powered extensions and helpers for interacting with the Graph SDK for .NET and making authenticated requests to Graph APIs:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Extensions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Call GetClient() or GetBetaClient() on any IProvider instance to get access to a pre-configured GraphServiceClient on demand.</span></li>
 	<li><b>OneDriveStorageHelper and UserExtensionStorageHelper</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – New helpers for storing settings and file data in Graph based storage locations, such as OneDrive or open extensions on the Graph User object.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the *.Graph.Uwp package has user controls and helpers for enhancing Graph powered UWP apps:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Controls</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – LoginButton, PeoplePicker, and PersonView (GraphPresenter is still experimental.)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>ProviderStateTrigger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – A StateTrigger for detecting when the global authentication provider has been signed in.</span></li>
 	<li><b>ElementExtensions.IsVisibleWhen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Extension on FrameworkElement for declaring element visibility behavior in response to authentication changes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Attached Shadows - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/Ryken100">Chris Blackman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michael-hawker">Michael Hawker</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Move over DropShadowPanel and hello Attached Shadows! Attached shadows make it even easier to add this great depth effect to your app, now without having to modify your layout! </span><a href="https://twitter.com/justinxinliu/status/1425642561763377152"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re even used in the Microsoft Store App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56366 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/StoreImage.jpg" alt="Microsoft Store home page" width="1920" height="1080" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DropShadowPanel is one of the Toolkit’s most popular controls, but its big issue is that it needs to wrap around the content you want to have the shadow on. This makes adding shadows later in development tricky as it affects how you’ve laid out an entire element.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with an attached shadow, you can sprinkle them in afterward wherever they’re needed. They can even be applied in styles to update multiple elements in your app at once! And they even hook into the new XAML Animation system we shipped last release, so everything works seamlessly together!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of these attached shadows in this release: the AttachedCardShadow and the AttachedDropShadow. Read our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/docs/attachedshadow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which outlines where it is best to use each type of shadow.</span>
<h3><strong>AttachedCardShadow using Win2D</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The AttachedCardShadow is a rectangular-based shadow (which supports rounded corners) that can be applied directly to an element without the need for any other configuration. It should be your new go-to shadow option if you don’t mind the Win2D dependency it requires.</span>
<h3><strong>AttachedDropShadow using Composition</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The AttachedDropShadow supports masked shadows for transparent images, shapes, and text. It uses the composition layer, so it’ll work with any UWP app. It has inherited the implementation of DropShadowPanel, but it works a bit differently. Be sure to check out our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/docs/attachedshadow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">samples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more.</span>
<h3><strong>RichSuggestBox - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/huynhsontung">Tung Huynh</a></strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56362 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image5.png" alt="" width="915" height="248" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The RichSuggestBox is a RichEditBox that provides the additional functionality of being able to select tokens from a list of suggestions, like ‘@’ mentioning someone in a chat message or tagging a document to include in a note. It provides a similar pattern that our TokenizingTextBox control provides, but instead of just being for a set of fixed elements it allows for more free-form text input sprinkled with metadata.</span>
<h2><strong>WinUI 2.7 and other Improvements!</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve updated to base on control packages on the new WinUI 2.6 and 2.7 update which also includes updated styles. We’ll continue to update our control styles with the new design guidance over time.</span>

<h2><strong>On The Horizon</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>MVVM Source Generator [Preview] - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/sergio0694">Sergio Pedri</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MVVM Toolkit now has support for </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (in preview). This makes the library more flexible, easier to use, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more efficient</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following is a small sample of some source generator attributes in action. On the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">left-hand side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the original hand-written example using the MVVM Toolkit, as you would today. On the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-hand side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is how you can use the new attributes to automatically generate the exact same code!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56363 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image4.png" alt="" width="1429" height="564" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can already see the impact Source Generators can have to save you from having to write extra “boiler-plate” type code! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">🤯</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brand-new feature is being developed with the same original core principles of the MVVM Toolkit in mind: being modular and “à la carte”. This means source generator support is bundled with the MVVM Toolkit, but still being completely optional: you’ll be free to use it everywhere, mix & match as needed, or ignore it altogether; it’s entirely up to you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of the new features:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableProperty]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute creates a super compact way of creating an observable property from just a field and annotation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[AlsoNotifyChangeFor]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be used to raise a change notification for another dependent property.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ICommand]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute will let you annotate methods in a ViewModel and generate all the corresponding command properties. This includes support for generic commands and asynchronous commands: just annotate an async method returning a Task!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also annotate a class with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[INotifyPropertyChanged]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableObject]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableRecipient]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableValidator]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to inject all the boilerplate code needed to use those MVVM helpers while still inheriting from other base classes! You can also use this to mix together inheriting from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ObservableRecipient</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then add the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableValidator]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute to combine all APIs from both classes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s more planned for the future, both in terms of new features and performance improvements!</span>
<h3><strong>Introducing Toolkit Labs 🧪</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Windows Community Toolkit has grown, we’ve raised the bar on the quality of our code and the process we use for vetting new features being introduced. This helps our community know they’re getting quality items in each of our releases, but it can slow down the pace at which we can innovate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation has been the life of the Toolkit. Rapidly prototyping ideas, gathering community feedback, and shipping things folks need have been instrumental to how the Toolkit works. For this reason, we’re introducing “Community Toolkit Labs”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Labs will be a place where we can incubate and work on new features in a safe space outside our normal code base and ship cycles. It’ll be easier to get started working on code and collaborating with others before having to worry about the docs, samples, and tests required to ship a fully fleshed-out idea and feature within the Toolkit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, we plan to have a centralized Labs repository for smaller features and controls to be proposed, incubated, and worked in with the community. Be on the lookout for more info about this new space in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have a dedicated NuGet feed for Toolkit Labs in our public DevOps package feed. You can find out more about these types of </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/wiki/previewpackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preview Feeds on our Wiki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also have larger ideas that have their own repository underneath the Labs banner, like the first ones we’re introducing today…</span>
<h3><strong>Intelligent APIs - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/amrutha95">Amrutha Srinivasan</a></strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56365 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image7.jpg" alt="" width="927" height="517" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Intelligent APIs” is a project whose goal is to make machine learning easier for developers to leverage in their applications without needing ML expertise! By just importing a NuGet package and calling a function, we want developers to be able to build intelligent app experiences without needing to deal with the complexities of creating and using machine learning models on Windows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently experimenting with this concept by wrapping two existing state-of-the-art models into NuGet packages. They enable the developer to add image classification and object detection capabilities quickly and easily into their projects with a single function call.</span>

<a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-IntelligentAPIs"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about how to get started with Intelligent APIs here.</span></i></a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56364 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image6.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="594" />
<h3><strong>Gaze Controls - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/harishsk">Harish Kulkarni</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These new Gaze Controls can empower users whose primary form of input is to use their eyes. These controls have been designed for Gaze interaction first above other forms of input. They include a FilePicker, a Keyboard, and a Scrollbar. Find out more or contribute to </span><a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-GazeControls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their dedicated repo here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><strong>Windows App SDK Previews (formally Project Reunion)</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you hopefully know, we have been shipping versions of the Toolkit that work for WinUI 3 alongside their releases as part of the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows App SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have released a version of the toolkit which works for Desktop apps with .NET for the Windows App SDK 0.8.4 release. </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct-winui3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more details on how to try this out here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a reminder these WinUI 3 based packages use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.WinUI.*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the root vs. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft.Toolkit.UWP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll have more info about the upcoming 1.0 release support in the future and plan to ship an update that includes our 7.1 changes as well.</span>
<h2><strong>Get started today! 🎉</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a ton of fixes, other helpers, and improvements across the board from our community this release, so be sure to visit our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/releasenotes/7.1.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all the details!</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows 11 brings refinement to contextual file operations in the right-click context menu and share dialog. These are extensible by apps, including unpackaged Win32 apps. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The context menu is one of the most popular and useful shell extensions. If you are already in File Explorer or on the Desktop, it significantly reduces the number of steps to complete a file operation compared to opening a separate app.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As useful as the Windows 10 context menu is, there are aspects of its design we sought to improve in Windows 11.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common commands - cut, copy, paste, delete, and rename - are far from the mouse pointer, touch point, or pen.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The menu is exceptionally long. It has grown in an unregulated environment for 20 years, since Windows XP, when IContextMenu was introduced.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes commands which are rarely used.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands that should be grouped together – such as Open and Open with – are sometimes far apart.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps have no common organizational schema and can interrupt sections of inbox commands.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps are not attributable to the app itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many commands run in-process in Explorer, which can cause performance and reliability issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56314 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/W10-Context-Menu-with-Contoso-Replacements-and-Defender-Fix-458x1024.png" alt="" width="458" height="1024" />

<strong>The Windows 11 context menu addresses these problems in the following ways:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common commands are placed right next to where the menu is invoked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open” and “Open with” are grouped together.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps extend the menu with IExplorerCommand + app identity. Unpackaged Win32 apps can use </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparse Manifests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. IExplorerCommand support extends back to Windows 7.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">App extensions are grouped together below Shell verbs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cfapi/build-a-cloud-file-sync-engine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Files provider apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are placed next to the Shell commands to hydrate or dehydrate the file.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps with more than 1 verb are grouped into a flyout with app attribution.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Show more options” loads the Windows 10 context menu as-is for access to low-use Shell verbs and apps still working on porting over. No commands have been removed entirely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shift-F10 or the keyboard menu key will also load the Windows 10 context menu.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56293" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image3.png" alt="" width="648" height="1060" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The share dialog has also been improved in Windows 11.</strong> </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby sharing is now much easier to use, with easy control over your discoverability setting up top and a link to more settings in the footer of the dialog.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use the Mail app, the first entry in the contacts list helps you easily send an email to yourself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All apps can now participate in the Share dialog as targets. For unpackaged Win32 apps, this is covered in </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same sample</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the context menu. PWAs installed through Microsoft Edge are also supported if they implement the Web Share Target API.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56294" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image2.png" alt="" width="799" height="1104" />
<h3><b>Context Menu Best Practices</b></h3>
<b>Regarding File Opening scenarios:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. When should I register my app for “Open with”? (File Type associations)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new context menu moves “Open with” to the top of the menu, right next to “Open.” </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app can open the file to do something more with it, you should always register for any applicable File Type Associations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Universal openers,” like technical text editors, should register to handle *</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so they will always be offered as an “Open with” option. They should also explicitly register for any filetypes they are optimized to handle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. When should I add a verb to “Edit with (app)”?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common for certain file types to be both “viewable/runnable” and “editable,” such as scripts, HTML, images, or text-based document formats. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the default action on double-click for these files can be “open/run” or “edit,” one of these two actions will be less convenient.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these cases, adding a verb for “Edit with (app name)” is an acceptable practice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, please consider if your non-power-users will be adequately served by “Open with.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these users, a default state of not including the verb unless users opt into it will keep the menu tidier in general while offering classic functionality to your power users.</span></p>
<b>Regarding File Sharing scenarios:</b><b>
</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. When should I add a Context Menu verb to “Share with (app)”?</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share actions can originate outside of File Explorer, for example the Photos app or Snip &amp; Sketch. In these cases, the Share dialog is shown to the user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best practice is to make sure you are registered as an app target in the Share dialog. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also OK to add a Context Menu verb for “Share with (app)”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Share dialog is also easily accessed from the File Explorer ribbon and context menu, an additional “Share with” verb in the context menu can be redundant - consider offering a way for users to opt out of the duplicate context menu verb.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we’re announcing ARM64EC (“Emulation Compatible”), a new way to build apps for Windows 11 on ARM. With the latest Visual Studio tools in preview and the Windows 11 Insider SDK, you'll be able to take advantage of ARM64EC to incrementally transition your app to running with native speed on ARM, even if you have dependencies or plugins that don't support ARM yet.
<h3>About ARM64EC</h3>
ARM64EC is a new application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM's built-in emulation.

The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the existing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160">ARM64 ABI</a> in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.
<h3>Developer Benefits</h3>
Traditionally, rebuilding an app for ARM has meant recompiling the entire app. The result is a great native experience for the customer that unlocks the full power of the ARM device. However, from a developer perspective, porting an app can be all-or-nothing, since all the binaries within a process need to be rebuilt before a customer can see the benefit.

With ARM64EC, you can choose to start small and build incrementally. You can identify a part of your codebase that would benefit most from native performance and rebuild it as ARM64EC. The rest of the app will remain fully functional as emulated x64, but the recompiled ARM64EC parts will now have native speed.  Over time, you can recompile more of the app as ARM64EC to further improve performance and conserve battery life for your app’s customers.

The ability to mix and match x64 and ARM64EC makes it possible to build an app for Windows 11 on ARM even if it depends on x64 code outside of your control. Projects with third-party dependencies that don't support ARM can leave them as x64.  And apps with an in-proc plugin ecosystem can build as ARM64EC to get native speed, while continuing to load and use x64 plugins.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
We're motivated by the potential of ARM64EC and excited to see the kinds of apps developers can build for Windows 11 on ARM using this technology. Internally, we’ve rebuilt the binaries of the Windows 11 on ARM operating system itself with ARM64EC so that any system code loaded by x64 apps runs with native speed.  In addition, the Office team is using ARM64EC in the coming <a href="https://aka.ms/officeforwindowsarmblog">64-bit Office for ARM</a> so that existing x64 plugins will work seamlessly.

You can get started with ARM64EC by downloading the latest <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">Windows Insider SDK</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/">Visual Studio Preview</a>, then following the steps on <a href="https://aka.ms/arm64ecgettingstarted">docs.microsoft.com</a> to add an ARM64EC configuration.  Looking forward, we'll have more content to share as we walk through in more detail how to take advantage of ARM64EC in your apps.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today at the What's next for Windows — developer event, we'll show you the next era of Windows and how we are embracing Windows == open platform. This means everyone has open access to run the widest range of apps on Windows, enabling all developers to build the apps and experiences that empower users to create, learn, and play. We focus on five key areas of improvement for Windows 11:
<ul>
 	<li>The new Microsoft Store;</li>
 	<li>Improvements in end-to-end Web development;</li>
 	<li>New features coming for native Windows apps;</li>
 	<li>The Fluent design system and WinUI; and</li>
 	<li>What's new for game developers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking advantage of the new Microsoft Store</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56247" align="aligncenter" width="1600"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56247" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Hero_1600x600_1X.png" alt="" width="1600" height="600" /> <em>Image 1: The new Microsoft Store spotlight section on the homepage.</em>[/caption]

We unveil the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">new Microsoft Store on Windows</a>, and announce our support for more app types such as Win32, .NET, and PWAs, as well as support for Android apps from the Amazon Appstore. The Store is also redesigned to keep your customers in their flow and make it easier to search for and discover curated stories and collections. With new features like the "pop-up" Store your users can install apps directly from the browser. You will also have more revenue sharing options, such as keeping 100% when you bring your own commerce platform for the Store for your app (this does not include PC games). A preview of the new Store will be available soon to Windows Insiders.
<h3>Using our dev tools to improve Web and native Windows app development</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56243" align="aligncenter" width="1916"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56243" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Media-Progressive-Web-App-Shortcuts-integrated-with-Windows.png" alt="" width="1916" height="912" /> <em>Image 2: Progressive Web App Shortcuts integrated with Windows</em>[/caption]

With Windows 11, we are embracing all your apps and are working to make all apps feel right at home on Windows. And, with the new <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWABuilder3</a>, you can build a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/">PWA</a> from your web app in minutes. The evergreen <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> runtime is also included with Windows 11 making it easier to take advantage of its web platform as a performant and secure way to build hybrid web apps. Of course, you can continue to use powerful developer offerings like Windows Terminal and the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2021/04/devtools">Microsoft Edge DevTools</a> as they are now in-box.

The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK</a>, formerly known as Project Reunion, will make it easier for you to integrate Windows 11 features into your apps while still enabling you to reach more than 1B users on Windows 10. We will continue to build the Windows App SDK in cooperation with the community and starting today, you can use the Windows App SDK 0.8 Stable release (still called Project Reunion in the NuGet package and Visual Studio Marketplace). In this release you will find stability updates for WinUI3 and support for developing for Visual Studio 16.10. The Windows App SDK 1.0 will be released later this year.

You can also build apps that run natively on Windows on ARM with the new ARM64 Emulation Compatible ABI. Using the ARM64EC, you can mix native ARM and emulated x64 code in the same process or module. This interoperability means you can optimize your app to run on Windows on ARM even if your app has x64 dependencies or loads x64 plugins you don't control.
<h3>Refreshing your apps and experiences so they are more engaging</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56244" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56244" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/D2-Design-Blog-Image.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /> <em>Image 3: Use UI with rounded geometry, leverage micro-interactions, and apply a refreshed color palette with new materials to make your apps look great in Windows 11. </em>[/caption]

If you want to rejuvenate your app design and experiences to feel at home on Windows 11, you can use WinUI3 to take advantage of the built-in UI update such as rounded geometry, refreshed iconography, new typography, fun micro-interactions (such as Lottie animation), and refreshed color palette. New materials like Mica also add meaningful hierarchy, and more. Snap layouts will also ensure you and your users will be productive on Windows 11.

You can also easily create and manage your app's windows using Reunion Windowing. It works with your existing app code, simplifies common operations, and brings new functionality to your desktop apps like light-dismiss behavior, picture-in-picture mode, and easier titlebar customization.
<h3>Developing awesome games for both PC and Console</h3>
To simplify game development for PCs, we are making our Game Development Kit (GDK) publicly available, free of charge <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/gdk">on GitHub</a>. The GDK contains the common tools, libraries, and documentation needed to build games for the PC and is the same base GDK used by thousands of developers today to deliver great experiences for players everywhere. The GDK adds to the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games">Game Stack</a> collection of technologies we offer today to help developers create, publish, monetize, and scale their games.

[caption id="attachment_56245" align="aligncenter" width="1306"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56245" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Auto-HDR-side-by-side.png" alt="" width="1306" height="550" /> <em>Image 4: Luminance heatmap showing SDR, Auto HDR and Native HDR</em>[/caption]

We also annnounce that great game play technology, previously only available on console, is now available on Windows 11 including DirectStorage. To get all the benefits of DirectStorage, you’ll need a PCIe 3.0+ NVMe SSD and a GPU that supports DirectX 12 and Shader Model 6.0+. This enables reduced load times and more expansive, detailed, living worlds. As well as Auto HDR, which automatically updates DirectX 11 and newer games with enhanced lighting and color to high dynamic range with no additional work needed by you or your players.

We look forward to collaborating with you to make progress on each of these efforts, so we can build productive, engaging, and immersive experiences together.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust for Windows v0.9 has recently been released and includes full consumption support, along with several other updates! With completed consumption support, you can now call any Windows APIs (past, present, and future) using the Rust language projection. Rust developers have access to the entire Windows API surface in a language-idiomatic way, allowing them to easily take advantage of the power and breadth of Windows development. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this latest release, we have added new content to Microsoft Docs on </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing with Rust on Windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is also a new </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-oZrsCPKsn4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video for those who want to dive in! For more information on the project, check out the Rust for Windows </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Github repo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates and Improvements</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made great progress since last year’s </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust/WinRT public preview announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with continued improvements and investment in the project. Some of the changes and updates since this last announcement include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added support for Win32 and COM APIs, unifying the Windows APIs available for consumption via the </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate. The addition of these APIs is enabled by the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this increased coverage and unification of Windows APIs, we changed the name of the project from “Rust/WinRT” to “Rust for Windows”.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added several </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Rust for Windows repo, demonstrating how to call a wide range of Windows APIs (includes Win32, COM, and WinRT APIs).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate is published on crates.io and is now dual-licensed under MIT or Apache. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now uses generated bindings rather than hand-written bindings internally.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now builds on Linux.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many improvements and fixes for Win32 APIs, such as support for array types, a variety of string types, and updated metadata. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added more natural and idiomatic support for COM interfaces such as with return values, and support for additional APIs involving things like C-style unions and nested types. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved build times and error handling.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original API case is </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/pull/646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now preserved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will affect existing code using the windows crate.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformed QueryInterface-like functions into generic functions, making it safer and more convenient to call many COM-related functions.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more details and a more comprehensive list of updates, look at the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/docs/changelog.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changelog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Rust for Windows repo.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple example: Win32 APIs in Rust</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have recently added support for calling Win32 APIs in Rust, so I will walk through a simple example calling the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageBox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> function. First make sure you have your Rust development environment set up, which you can do by following </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these docs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The code for this example can also be found </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples/message_box"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, I created a new Rust project by running the following command in a command prompt: </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample&gt;cargo new message_box</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a new directory with the starter files for my Rust project. Navigate to this new directory, and create a nested bindings crate using the command below to house the generated bindings. By doing this, the build can cache the results of any imported bindings. </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample\message_box&gt;cargo new --lib bindings</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now opening my project in Visual Studio Code, the directory structure looks like this.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56204 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/05/rust1.png" alt="" width="452" height="578" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the outer Cargo.toml file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">message_box </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory, add the following dependency which tells Cargo that it now depends on the newly created bindings library.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
bindings = {path = "bindings"}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in the Cargo.toml file underneath the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folder, add the following dependencies to add the windows crate.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This will allow Cargo to download, build, and cache Windows support as a package.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"

[build-dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, in Visual Studio Code I created a new file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">folder named build.rs. In this file, use the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows::build</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> macro to specify the types that you want to use as shown below. You can list any additional APIs you want to use in this build script. The windows crate will then generate the necessary bindings directly from metadata.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">// build.rs
fn main() {
    windows::build!(
    Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::MessageBoxA
    );
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next in the lib.rs file under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings/src, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove the default code and add the following line, which includes the source code generated by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build.rs</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">windows::include_bindings!();
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the main.rs file, you can now make use of any of the specified Windows APIs. Paste the following code, which creates a message box with a “Hello World” message. Note that any Win32 functions and COM interface methods should be marked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsafe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">use bindings::Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::{MessageBoxA,  MESSAGEBOX_STYLE};
 
fn main() {
    unsafe {
        MessageBoxA(None, "Hello", "World", MESSAGEBOX_STYLE::MB_OK);
    }
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Run </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo build </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo run</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a command prompt from the root directory of the sample, and you will see the following output!</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56197" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/H2Q4w9xg_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />Daniel Paulino created his first Windows app when he was at a career crossroads: Was he good enough to have a successful career as a developer? He wasn’t sure, but Daniel also knew he needed a timer app that connected to his workout band. “At the time, no app did this. I had this curiosity. That drove me back into building apps,” Daniel says.

Daniel’s curiosity has served him well. Today, he is the creator of multiple Windows apps, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pillbox/9nblggh4x7vb">Pillbox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nightingale-rest-client/9n2t6f9f5zdn">Nightingale</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ambie-white-noise/9p07xnm5chp0">Ambie</a>. He is also a software engineer on the Windows apps team — and it’s safe to say Daniel is a Microsoft devices and tooling fanatic. “I’ve been around the block, but I keep coming back to Visual Studio, .NET, and WinUI. I’m addicted to Microsoft’s advanced set of tooling. It empowers me to take what’s in my brain and put it into an app.”

Looking at the many apps Daniel has released in the last five years, it would be easy to conclude his career path was straightforward — but from Daniel’s perspective, becoming a developer was more indirect: It came from following his passions.
<h3><strong>From a hobby to a career</strong></h3>
He was well into university before he considered software development as a career. Growing up, Daniel spent a lot of time in hospitals, watching doctors investigate both he and his mother’s medical issues. He became fascinated by the doctors’ curiosity and how they worked from interrogation and discovery to understand the root causes of disease.

This interest made Daniel plan to study Molecular Biology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver — until he had to take a course in Python. Daniel had always been drawn to computers, even though his family could not afford to buy a new one. Out of necessity, Daniel became the family expert at optimizing the operating system — he had even cleaned up the Windows OS registry on an old PC until it ran as well as the new devices his friends had.

Despite his passion for technology, Daniel never believed that his hobby could become a career — until that Python course, and after a guest speaker at his university asked him if he had ever heard of Bioinformatics. That moment changed the rest of his career: Daniel’s school offered a joint major program that fused his passions for medicine and immunology and his growing love for computer science. This discovery opened a new world.
<h3>Real-world problem solving</h3>
Looking back at his school experiences, Daniel is quick to recommend new developers build tools that solve real-world problems. He had a revelatory moment at his first bioinformatics job when his boss suggested that Daniel build the first-ever C++ tool that efficiently closed gaps in the human genome. The experience left an indelible mark: he was struck by how impactful his work could be.

Following this experience, Daniel applied and was accepted to a software engineering internship at Microsoft Garage. It was his first role exclusively as a developer. He and the four other interns on his team had four months to build their product, a Windows Phone app, from start to finish. While he learned a lot about collaboration, Daniel’s biggest takeaway was how much he needed to grow. Daniel recalls, “It was a very humbling experience. I wasn’t good enough at the time and that was hard to accept.” Daniel even considered removing computer science from his degree.

While he felt uncertain about what direction to take, Daniel turned to developing apps to solve real problems. “It was this passion and curiosity that reignited my interest in software. I didn’t actively stop myself from quitting, but I let myself be curious.”

<h3><strong>Empowering people with apps</strong></h3>
Daniel’s proudest achievement came from one of the apps he built during this time, Pillbox. The app tracks a user’s medication schedule and reminds users when to take their pills. He built it to help his mother keep track of her wide variety of medications.

His mother’s real-world challenge proved to be the perfect place for Daniel to put his app development skills to work. He was eager to help his mother and excited to learn about databases and notifications — two integral pieces of the app. Daniel’s mother also acted as his stakeholder, helping him make the app easier to use when she requested new features.

Developing Pillbox shaped how Daniel thinks about development: Not only had he learned how to work with a stakeholder, but he also got to see the impact the technology had on his mother. Even though she was far from a tech enthusiast, she could load all her information in the app, keep it up to date and easily share her information with her doctor.

What stuck with Daniel the most was how he was able to empower his mother. He says a defining moment came when “One day we went to the ER and the nurse asked if my mom took any medicines. When she showed them the app, the nurse was so excited and asked where she got it. My mom was able to say, ‘My son made it for me.’”

Daniel recommends this kind of real-world problem-solving. “Be curious. Build software that empowers people. That will teach you a lot about yourself.”
<h3><strong>Pursuing growth opportunities</strong></h3>
Daniel continued to develop Windows apps after he graduated from university — while also starting a full-time job building bioinformatics tools. His development skills and enthusiasm for software development grew faster than ever, thanks to this cycle of developing both at work and home. Eventually, he hit a learning ceiling and Daniel realized that he needed to focus exclusively on development as a career.

<img class="alignleft wp-image-56200 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/1585425084522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />For anyone looking to make a similar switch, Daniel says, “Keep in touch with your network. In the long run, this can open up new opportunities when it’s time. Just learning from your network also helps you grow.”

Ultimately, Daniel ended up working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. While many of his friends assumed that working at Microsoft would be the end of his development efforts after hours, becoming a full-time developer made Daniel even more excited about development. “I continued coding on the bus and the train. The process of coding at work — and then coding at home — doubled my learning speed,” Daniel says. The skills he was learning at work made the apps he developed at home much better. In turn, that practice made him better at work.
<h3><strong>Following his curiosity today</strong></h3>
Throughout his career, Daniel keeps coming back to empowering others. “When I discovered software, I realized I was creative. My outlet was code,” he says. Once he had this outlet, he wanted to use it to help other people.

Amid the pandemic, Daniel created Ambie, a white noise app designed to help you focus, sleep or meditate. “What drives me is channeling my creativity to help someone, whether that’s to get something done with Nightingale or help them improve their health,” Daniel says.

“Developers have a unique opportunity to build something in their apartment that can affect a lot of people around the world. I just want to keep growing and helping more and more people that way.”]]></content:encoded>
