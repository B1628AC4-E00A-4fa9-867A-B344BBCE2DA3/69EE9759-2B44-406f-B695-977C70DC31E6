										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows 11 brings refinement to contextual file operations in the right-click context menu and share dialog. These are extensible by apps, including unpackaged Win32 apps. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The context menu is one of the most popular and useful shell extensions. If you are already in File Explorer or on the Desktop, it significantly reduces the number of steps to complete a file operation compared to opening a separate app.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As useful as the Windows 10 context menu is, there are aspects of its design we sought to improve in Windows 11.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common commands - cut, copy, paste, delete, and rename - are far from the mouse pointer, touch point, or pen.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The menu is exceptionally long. It has grown in an unregulated environment for 20 years, since Windows XP, when IContextMenu was introduced.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes commands which are rarely used.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands that should be grouped together – such as Open and Open with – are sometimes far apart.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps have no common organizational schema and can interrupt sections of inbox commands.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps are not attributable to the app itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many commands run in-process in Explorer, which can cause performance and reliability issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56314 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/W10-Context-Menu-with-Contoso-Replacements-and-Defender-Fix-458x1024.png" alt="" width="458" height="1024" />

<strong>The Windows 11 context menu addresses these problems in the following ways:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common commands are placed right next to where the menu is invoked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open” and “Open with” are grouped together.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps extend the menu with IExplorerCommand + app identity. Unpackaged Win32 apps can use </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparse Manifests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. IExplorerCommand support extends back to Windows 7.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">App extensions are grouped together below Shell verbs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cfapi/build-a-cloud-file-sync-engine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Files provider apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are placed next to the Shell commands to hydrate or dehydrate the file.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps with more than 1 verb are grouped into a flyout with app attribution.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Show more options” loads the Windows 10 context menu as-is for access to low-use Shell verbs and apps still working on porting over. No commands have been removed entirely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shift-F10 or the keyboard menu key will also load the Windows 10 context menu.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56293" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image3.png" alt="" width="648" height="1060" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The share dialog has also been improved in Windows 11.</strong> </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby sharing is now much easier to use, with easy control over your discoverability setting up top and a link to more settings in the footer of the dialog.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use the Mail app, the first entry in the contacts list helps you easily send an email to yourself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All apps can now participate in the Share dialog as targets. For unpackaged Win32 apps, this is covered in </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same sample</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the context menu. PWAs installed through Microsoft Edge are also supported if they implement the Web Share Target API.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56294" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image2.png" alt="" width="799" height="1104" />
<h3><b>Context Menu Best Practices</b></h3>
<b>Regarding File Opening scenarios:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. When should I register my app for “Open with”? (File Type associations)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new context menu moves “Open with” to the top of the menu, right next to “Open.” </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app can open the file to do something more with it, you should always register for any applicable File Type Associations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Universal openers,” like technical text editors, should register to handle *</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so they will always be offered as an “Open with” option. They should also explicitly register for any filetypes they are optimized to handle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. When should I add a verb to “Edit with (app)”?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common for certain file types to be both “viewable/runnable” and “editable,” such as scripts, HTML, images, or text-based document formats. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the default action on double-click for these files can be “open/run” or “edit,” one of these two actions will be less convenient.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these cases, adding a verb for “Edit with (app name)” is an acceptable practice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, please consider if your non-power-users will be adequately served by “Open with.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these users, a default state of not including the verb unless users opt into it will keep the menu tidier in general while offering classic functionality to your power users.</span></p>
<b>Regarding File Sharing scenarios:</b><b>
</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. When should I add a Context Menu verb to “Share with (app)”?</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share actions can originate outside of File Explorer, for example the Photos app or Snip &amp; Sketch. In these cases, the Share dialog is shown to the user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best practice is to make sure you are registered as an app target in the Share dialog. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also OK to add a Context Menu verb for “Share with (app)”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Share dialog is also easily accessed from the File Explorer ribbon and context menu, an additional “Share with” verb in the context menu can be redundant - consider offering a way for users to opt out of the duplicate context menu verb.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we’re announcing ARM64EC (“Emulation Compatible”), a new way to build apps for Windows 11 on ARM. With the latest Visual Studio tools in preview and the Windows 11 Insider SDK, you'll be able to take advantage of ARM64EC to incrementally transition your app to running with native speed on ARM, even if you have dependencies or plugins that don't support ARM yet.
<h3>About ARM64EC</h3>
ARM64EC is a new application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM's built-in emulation.

The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the existing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160">ARM64 ABI</a> in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.
<h3>Developer Benefits</h3>
Traditionally, rebuilding an app for ARM has meant recompiling the entire app. The result is a great native experience for the customer that unlocks the full power of the ARM device. However, from a developer perspective, porting an app can be all-or-nothing, since all the binaries within a process need to be rebuilt before a customer can see the benefit.

With ARM64EC, you can choose to start small and build incrementally. You can identify a part of your codebase that would benefit most from native performance and rebuild it as ARM64EC. The rest of the app will remain fully functional as emulated x64, but the recompiled ARM64EC parts will now have native speed.  Over time, you can recompile more of the app as ARM64EC to further improve performance and conserve battery life for your app’s customers.

The ability to mix and match x64 and ARM64EC makes it possible to build an app for Windows 11 on ARM even if it depends on x64 code outside of your control. Projects with third-party dependencies that don't support ARM can leave them as x64.  And apps with an in-proc plugin ecosystem can build as ARM64EC to get native speed, while continuing to load and use x64 plugins.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
We're motivated by the potential of ARM64EC and excited to see the kinds of apps developers can build for Windows 11 on ARM using this technology. Internally, we’ve rebuilt the binaries of the Windows 11 on ARM operating system itself with ARM64EC so that any system code loaded by x64 apps runs with native speed.  In addition, the Office team is using ARM64EC in the coming <a href="https://aka.ms/officeforwindowsarmblog">64-bit Office for ARM</a> so that existing x64 plugins will work seamlessly.

You can get started with ARM64EC by downloading the latest <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">Windows Insider SDK</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/">Visual Studio Preview</a>, then following the steps on <a href="https://aka.ms/arm64ecgettingstarted">docs.microsoft.com</a> to add an ARM64EC configuration.  Looking forward, we'll have more content to share as we walk through in more detail how to take advantage of ARM64EC in your apps.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today at the What's next for Windows — developer event, we'll show you the next era of Windows and how we are embracing Windows == open platform. This means everyone has open access to run the widest range of apps on Windows, enabling all developers to build the apps and experiences that empower users to create, learn, and play. We focus on five key areas of improvement for Windows 11:
<ul>
 	<li>The new Microsoft Store;</li>
 	<li>Improvements in end-to-end Web development;</li>
 	<li>New features coming for native Windows apps;</li>
 	<li>The Fluent design system and WinUI; and</li>
 	<li>What's new for game developers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking advantage of the new Microsoft Store</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56247" align="aligncenter" width="1600"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56247" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Hero_1600x600_1X.png" alt="" width="1600" height="600" /> <em>Image 1: The new Microsoft Store spotlight section on the homepage.</em>[/caption]

We unveil the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">new Microsoft Store on Windows</a>, and announce our support for more app types such as Win32, .NET, and PWAs, as well as support for Android apps from the Amazon Appstore. The Store is also redesigned to keep your customers in their flow and make it easier to search for and discover curated stories and collections. With new features like the "pop-up" Store your users can install apps directly from the browser. You will also have more revenue sharing options, such as keeping 100% when you bring your own commerce platform for the Store for your app (this does not include PC games). A preview of the new Store will be available soon to Windows Insiders.
<h3>Using our dev tools to improve Web and native Windows app development</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56243" align="aligncenter" width="1916"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56243" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Media-Progressive-Web-App-Shortcuts-integrated-with-Windows.png" alt="" width="1916" height="912" /> <em>Image 2: Progressive Web App Shortcuts integrated with Windows</em>[/caption]

With Windows 11, we are embracing all your apps and are working to make all apps feel right at home on Windows. And, with the new <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWABuilder3</a>, you can build a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/">PWA</a> from your web app in minutes. The evergreen <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> runtime is also included with Windows 11 making it easier to take advantage of its web platform as a performant and secure way to build hybrid web apps. Of course, you can continue to use powerful developer offerings like Windows Terminal and the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2021/04/devtools">Microsoft Edge DevTools</a> as they are now in-box.

The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK</a>, formerly known as Project Reunion, will make it easier for you to integrate Windows 11 features into your apps while still enabling you to reach more than 1B users on Windows 10. We will continue to build the Windows App SDK in cooperation with the community and starting today, you can use the Windows App SDK 0.8 Stable release (still called Project Reunion in the NuGet package and Visual Studio Marketplace). In this release you will find stability updates for WinUI3 and support for developing for Visual Studio 16.10. The Windows App SDK 1.0 will be released later this year.

You can also build apps that run natively on Windows on ARM with the new ARM64 Emulation Compatible ABI. Using the ARM64EC, you can mix native ARM and emulated x64 code in the same process or module. This interoperability means you can optimize your app to run on Windows on ARM even if your app has x64 dependencies or loads x64 plugins you don't control.
<h3>Refreshing your apps and experiences so they are more engaging</h3>
[caption id="attachment_56244" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56244" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/D2-Design-Blog-Image.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /> <em>Image 3: Use UI with rounded geometry, leverage micro-interactions, and apply a refreshed color palette with new materials to make your apps look great in Windows 11. </em>[/caption]

If you want to rejuvenate your app design and experiences to feel at home on Windows 11, you can use WinUI3 to take advantage of the built-in UI update such as rounded geometry, refreshed iconography, new typography, fun micro-interactions (such as Lottie animation), and refreshed color palette. New materials like Mica also add meaningful hierarchy, and more. Snap layouts will also ensure you and your users will be productive on Windows 11.

You can also easily create and manage your app's windows using Reunion Windowing. It works with your existing app code, simplifies common operations, and brings new functionality to your desktop apps like light-dismiss behavior, picture-in-picture mode, and easier titlebar customization.
<h3>Developing awesome games for both PC and Console</h3>
To simplify game development for PCs, we are making our Game Development Kit (GDK) publicly available, free of charge <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/gdk">on GitHub</a>. The GDK contains the common tools, libraries, and documentation needed to build games for the PC and is the same base GDK used by thousands of developers today to deliver great experiences for players everywhere. The GDK adds to the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games">Game Stack</a> collection of technologies we offer today to help developers create, publish, monetize, and scale their games.

[caption id="attachment_56245" align="aligncenter" width="1306"]<img class="size-full wp-image-56245" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/06/Auto-HDR-side-by-side.png" alt="" width="1306" height="550" /> <em>Image 4: Luminance heatmap showing SDR, Auto HDR and Native HDR</em>[/caption]

We also annnounce that great game play technology, previously only available on console, is now available on Windows 11 including DirectStorage. To get all the benefits of DirectStorage, you’ll need a PCIe 3.0+ NVMe SSD and a GPU that supports DirectX 12 and Shader Model 6.0+. This enables reduced load times and more expansive, detailed, living worlds. As well as Auto HDR, which automatically updates DirectX 11 and newer games with enhanced lighting and color to high dynamic range with no additional work needed by you or your players.

We look forward to collaborating with you to make progress on each of these efforts, so we can build productive, engaging, and immersive experiences together.

<span data-contrast="none">This year’s Microsoft Build is packed with news tailored specifically for developers. Our team has been hard at work creating useful tools and improving the developer experience for anyone who develops on Windows, including innovations with Terminal and WSL2. Additionally, we are unifying the Windows Desktop Application development with Project Reunion. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="none">Check out our shortlist of the top Windows developer updates from Microsoft Build 2021 to learn more about how you can improve your development workflow:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust for Windows v0.9 has recently been released and includes full consumption support, along with several other updates! With completed consumption support, you can now call any Windows APIs (past, present, and future) using the Rust language projection. Rust developers have access to the entire Windows API surface in a language-idiomatic way, allowing them to easily take advantage of the power and breadth of Windows development. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this latest release, we have added new content to Microsoft Docs on </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing with Rust on Windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is also a new </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-oZrsCPKsn4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video for those who want to dive in! For more information on the project, check out the Rust for Windows </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Github repo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates and Improvements</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made great progress since last year’s </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust/WinRT public preview announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with continued improvements and investment in the project. Some of the changes and updates since this last announcement include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added support for Win32 and COM APIs, unifying the Windows APIs available for consumption via the </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate. The addition of these APIs is enabled by the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this increased coverage and unification of Windows APIs, we changed the name of the project from “Rust/WinRT” to “Rust for Windows”.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added several </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Rust for Windows repo, demonstrating how to call a wide range of Windows APIs (includes Win32, COM, and WinRT APIs).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate is published on crates.io and is now dual-licensed under MIT or Apache. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now uses generated bindings rather than hand-written bindings internally.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows crate now builds on Linux.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many improvements and fixes for Win32 APIs, such as support for array types, a variety of string types, and updated metadata. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added more natural and idiomatic support for COM interfaces such as with return values, and support for additional APIs involving things like C-style unions and nested types. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved build times and error handling.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original API case is </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/pull/646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now preserved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will affect existing code using the windows crate.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformed QueryInterface-like functions into generic functions, making it safer and more convenient to call many COM-related functions.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more details and a more comprehensive list of updates, look at the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/docs/changelog.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changelog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Rust for Windows repo.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple example: Win32 APIs in Rust</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have recently added support for calling Win32 APIs in Rust, so I will walk through a simple example calling the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MessageBox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> function. First make sure you have your Rust development environment set up, which you can do by following </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these docs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The code for this example can also be found </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/examples/message_box"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, I created a new Rust project by running the following command in a command prompt: </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample&gt;cargo new message_box</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a new directory with the starter files for my Rust project. Navigate to this new directory, and create a nested bindings crate using the command below to house the generated bindings. By doing this, the build can cache the results of any imported bindings. </span>
<pre style="padding-left: 40px;">C:\sample\message_box&gt;cargo new --lib bindings</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now opening my project in Visual Studio Code, the directory structure looks like this.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56204 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/05/rust1.png" alt="" width="452" height="578" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the outer Cargo.toml file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">message_box </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directory, add the following dependency which tells Cargo that it now depends on the newly created bindings library.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
bindings = {path = "bindings"}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in the Cargo.toml file underneath the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folder, add the following dependencies to add the windows crate.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This will allow Cargo to download, build, and cache Windows support as a package.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">[dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"

[build-dependencies]
windows = "0.9.1"
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, in Visual Studio Code I created a new file directly under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">folder named build.rs. In this file, use the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows::build</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> macro to specify the types that you want to use as shown below. You can list any additional APIs you want to use in this build script. The windows crate will then generate the necessary bindings directly from metadata.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">// build.rs
fn main() {
    windows::build!(
    Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::MessageBoxA
    );
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next in the lib.rs file under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bindings/src, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove the default code and add the following line, which includes the source code generated by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build.rs</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">windows::include_bindings!();
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the main.rs file, you can now make use of any of the specified Windows APIs. Paste the following code, which creates a message box with a “Hello World” message. Note that any Win32 functions and COM interface methods should be marked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsafe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="rust">use bindings::Windows::Win32::WindowsAndMessaging::{MessageBoxA,  MESSAGEBOX_STYLE};
 
fn main() {
    unsafe {
        MessageBoxA(None, "Hello", "World", MESSAGEBOX_STYLE::MB_OK);
    }
}
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Run </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo build </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cargo run</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a command prompt from the root directory of the sample, and you will see the following output!</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56197" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/H2Q4w9xg_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />Daniel Paulino created his first Windows app when he was at a career crossroads: Was he good enough to have a successful career as a developer? He wasn’t sure, but Daniel also knew he needed a timer app that connected to his workout band. “At the time, no app did this. I had this curiosity. That drove me back into building apps,” Daniel says.

Daniel’s curiosity has served him well. Today, he is the creator of multiple Windows apps, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pillbox/9nblggh4x7vb">Pillbox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nightingale-rest-client/9n2t6f9f5zdn">Nightingale</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ambie-white-noise/9p07xnm5chp0">Ambie</a>. He is also a software engineer on the Windows apps team — and it’s safe to say Daniel is a Microsoft devices and tooling fanatic. “I’ve been around the block, but I keep coming back to Visual Studio, .NET, and WinUI. I’m addicted to Microsoft’s advanced set of tooling. It empowers me to take what’s in my brain and put it into an app.”

Looking at the many apps Daniel has released in the last five years, it would be easy to conclude his career path was straightforward — but from Daniel’s perspective, becoming a developer was more indirect: It came from following his passions.
<h3><strong>From a hobby to a career</strong></h3>
He was well into university before he considered software development as a career. Growing up, Daniel spent a lot of time in hospitals, watching doctors investigate both he and his mother’s medical issues. He became fascinated by the doctors’ curiosity and how they worked from interrogation and discovery to understand the root causes of disease.

This interest made Daniel plan to study Molecular Biology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver — until he had to take a course in Python. Daniel had always been drawn to computers, even though his family could not afford to buy a new one. Out of necessity, Daniel became the family expert at optimizing the operating system — he had even cleaned up the Windows OS registry on an old PC until it ran as well as the new devices his friends had.

Despite his passion for technology, Daniel never believed that his hobby could become a career — until that Python course, and after a guest speaker at his university asked him if he had ever heard of Bioinformatics. That moment changed the rest of his career: Daniel’s school offered a joint major program that fused his passions for medicine and immunology and his growing love for computer science. This discovery opened a new world.
<h3>Real-world problem solving</h3>
Looking back at his school experiences, Daniel is quick to recommend new developers build tools that solve real-world problems. He had a revelatory moment at his first bioinformatics job when his boss suggested that Daniel build the first-ever C++ tool that efficiently closed gaps in the human genome. The experience left an indelible mark: he was struck by how impactful his work could be.

Following this experience, Daniel applied and was accepted to a software engineering internship at Microsoft Garage. It was his first role exclusively as a developer. He and the four other interns on his team had four months to build their product, a Windows Phone app, from start to finish. While he learned a lot about collaboration, Daniel’s biggest takeaway was how much he needed to grow. Daniel recalls, “It was a very humbling experience. I wasn’t good enough at the time and that was hard to accept.” Daniel even considered removing computer science from his degree.

While he felt uncertain about what direction to take, Daniel turned to developing apps to solve real problems. “It was this passion and curiosity that reignited my interest in software. I didn’t actively stop myself from quitting, but I let myself be curious.”

<h3><strong>Empowering people with apps</strong></h3>
Daniel’s proudest achievement came from one of the apps he built during this time, Pillbox. The app tracks a user’s medication schedule and reminds users when to take their pills. He built it to help his mother keep track of her wide variety of medications.

His mother’s real-world challenge proved to be the perfect place for Daniel to put his app development skills to work. He was eager to help his mother and excited to learn about databases and notifications — two integral pieces of the app. Daniel’s mother also acted as his stakeholder, helping him make the app easier to use when she requested new features.

Developing Pillbox shaped how Daniel thinks about development: Not only had he learned how to work with a stakeholder, but he also got to see the impact the technology had on his mother. Even though she was far from a tech enthusiast, she could load all her information in the app, keep it up to date and easily share her information with her doctor.

What stuck with Daniel the most was how he was able to empower his mother. He says a defining moment came when “One day we went to the ER and the nurse asked if my mom took any medicines. When she showed them the app, the nurse was so excited and asked where she got it. My mom was able to say, ‘My son made it for me.’”

[caption id="attachment_56199" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-56199 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/DP_and_Mom-300x294.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="294" /> Daniel with his mom at his graduation from Simon Fraser University.[/caption]

Daniel recommends this kind of real-world problem-solving. “Be curious. Build software that empowers people. That will teach you a lot about yourself.”
<h3><strong>Pursuing growth opportunities</strong></h3>
Daniel continued to develop Windows apps after he graduated from university — while also starting a full-time job building bioinformatics tools. His development skills and enthusiasm for software development grew faster than ever, thanks to this cycle of developing both at work and home. Eventually, he hit a learning ceiling and Daniel realized that he needed to focus exclusively on development as a career.

<img class="alignleft wp-image-56200 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/1585425084522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />For anyone looking to make a similar switch, Daniel says, “Keep in touch with your network. In the long run, this can open up new opportunities when it’s time. Just learning from your network also helps you grow.”

Ultimately, Daniel ended up working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. While many of his friends assumed that working at Microsoft would be the end of his development efforts after hours, becoming a full-time developer made Daniel even more excited about development. “I continued coding on the bus and the train. The process of coding at work — and then coding at home — doubled my learning speed,” Daniel says. The skills he was learning at work made the apps he developed at home much better. In turn, that practice made him better at work.
<h3><strong>Following his curiosity today</strong></h3>
Throughout his career, Daniel keeps coming back to empowering others. “When I discovered software, I realized I was creative. My outlet was code,” he says. Once he had this outlet, he wanted to use it to help other people.

Amid the pandemic, Daniel created Ambie, a white noise app designed to help you focus, sleep or meditate. “What drives me is channeling my creativity to help someone, whether that’s to get something done with Nightingale or help them improve their health,” Daniel says.

“Developers have a unique opportunity to build something in their apartment that can affect a lot of people around the world. I just want to keep growing and helping more and more people that way.”]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">After many months of invigorating the Windows Community Toolkit with a multitude of improvements and features; we are happy to announce version 7.0 is available today! Made possible again with the support and contributions of our developer community</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">🎉</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you are new to the Toolkit, the Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helpers, extensions, and custom controls. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks for building UWP and .NET apps for Windows 10. The toolkit is part of the .NET Foundation. You can </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span data-contrast="none">download our Sample App</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> playground to discover and try Toolkit components before getting started on a project</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This new update includes a whole new .NET Standard MVVM library, easier to use Toast Notification helpers for both .NET and UWP, a completely revamped composition Animation system for C# &amp; XAML, new controls, and more!</span><span data-contrast="auto">!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This is one of the largest releases of the Toolkit ever as we embarked to optimize and streamline the Toolkit for the future. However, it also contains many breaking changes to pay attention to both around its underlying structure and code contracts. Please be sure to read </span><a href="https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/releases/tag/v7.0.0"><span data-contrast="none">our release notes here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, some high-level overviews are provided below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">There should be something for everyone in this release as it includes a wide variety of features; we hope you will enjoy them for building .NET and UWP apps on Windows 10.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We have refactored many packages within the Toolkit.
