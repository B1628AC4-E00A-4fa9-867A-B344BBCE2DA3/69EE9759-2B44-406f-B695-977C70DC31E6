										<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the latest Windows 11 update on Sept. 26 we released a host of developer features as the core component of the Windows OS with an intent to make every developer more productive on Windows. Today we are excited to announce Windows AI Studio, a new AI experience to help enterprises and developers jumpstart local AI development and deployment on Windows, along with new updates to Dev Home and new enterprise features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that enhance security and simplify deployment.
<h3><strong>Windows AI Studio simplifies generative AI app development</strong></h3>
Many developers and enterprises want to bring AI differentiated experiences to their apps and we have heard from these developers that they need an easier and trusted way to get started with local AI development. With many tools, frameworks and open-source models available it is difficult to pick the right set of tools to test, fine-tune and optimize the models or select the most trusted models that best fit diverse business needs. That’s why we are thrilled to announce Windows AI Studio, a new experience for developers, that extends the tooling of Azure AI Studio to jumpstart AI development locally on Windows.
<h3><strong>Getting started with AI development locally on Windows is easier and faster than ever</strong></h3>
<a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio</a> simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from Azure AI Studio and other catalogs like Hugging Face, enabling developers to fine-tune, customize and deploy state-of-the-art small language models, or SLMs, for local use in their Windows apps. This includes an e2e guided workspace setup that includes model configuration UI and guided walkthroughs to fine-tune popular SLMs like Phi. Developers can then rapidly test their fine-tuned model using the Prompt Flow and Gradio templates integrated into the workspace.

Windows AI Studio brings us closer to supporting Hybrid Loop development patterns and enabling hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. This gives developers greater choice either to run their models on the cloud on Azure or on the edge locally on Windows (or across the two) to meet their needs. Prompt Flow makes it easier than ever to implement this hybrid pattern by switching between local SLMs and cloud LLMs.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56895 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/11/Model-flow-dark1920-1024x289.png" alt="Graph showing a typical fine-tuning workflow" width="1024" height="289" />

The picture above shows a typical fine-tuning workflow. Developers will bring their own datasets for fine-tuning. See our fine-tuning guide for details on how to get started. Note that the fine-tuning + model evaluation steps will be iterative until the model meets the developers’ evaluation criteria.

In the coming weeks developers can access <a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio as a VS Code Extension</a>, a familiar and seamless interface to help you get started with AI development. The guided interface allows you to focus on what you do best, coding, while we do all the heavy lifting by setting your developer environment with all the tools needed. <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/ai">Learn more</a> about Windows AI Studio.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56898 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/11/Step-31920-1024x548.jpg" alt="Windows AI Studio Step 3: Generating project" width="1024" height="548" />
<h3><strong>Windows optimized state-of-the-art models</strong></h3>
In addition to fine-tuning capabilities, Windows AI Studio will also highlight state-of-the-art (SOTA) models optimized specifically for Windows GPUs and NPUs in the future, starting with Llama 2-7B, Mistral-7B, Falcon-7B, and Stable Diffusion XL. Earlier this year, we talked about how ONNX Runtime is the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/unlocking-the-end-to-end-windows-ai-developer-experience-using-onnx-runtime-and-olive/">gateway to Windows AI</a>. DirectML is the native Windows machine learning API, and together they give developers access to a simplified yet highly performant AI development experience. With <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models, developers can ensure that their models run as performantly as possible with the DirectML+ONNX Runtime combo.

At Inspire this year we shared details on how developers will be able to run Llama 2 with <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">DirectML and the ONNX Runtime</a> and we have been hard at work to make this a reality. We now have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">sample</a> showing our progress with Llama 2 7B; after an Olive optimization pass, our sample shows how developers can now run this versatile LLM locally and performantly on varied Windows hardware. We're excited about this milestone, and this is only a first peek. Stay tuned for future enhancements to support even larger models, fine-tuning and lower-precision data types.  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56883">Learn more.</a>

<strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) </strong>offers a robust platform for AI development on Windows by making it easy to run Windows and Linux workloads simultaneously. Developers can easily share files, GUI apps, GPU and more between environments with no additional setup. WSL is now enhanced to meet the enterprise grade security requirements so enterprise customers can confidently deploy WSL for their developers to take advantage of both Windows and Linux operating systems on the same Windows device and accelerate AI development efficiently.
<h3><strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux now offers new enterprise features that enhance security and simplify deployment </strong></h3>
It’s now easier than ever to securely deploy WSL to your company with the latest enterprise features. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint released a new plug-in for WSL that enables security teams to continuously monitor events in all running distributions – delivering unparalleled visibility into systems once considered a critical blind spot.</li>
 	<li>Access to WSL and its key security settings are now controllable with Intune. Admins can configure access to WSL entirely, or dive into access to specific security settings like custom kernel, nested virtualization and more, to ensure security while using WSL.</li>
 	<li>Advanced networking controls in WSL let you specify firewall rules that apply to the WSL virtual machine and improve network compatibility in complex enterprise environments. <a href="https://aka.ms/wslenterpriseblogpost">Learn more</a> to get started with WSL today!</li>
</ul>
We want to ensure Windows is optimized for developers and helps you be productive across any development you do – desktop, web, AI or cross-platform. That’s why we introduced Dev Home, your ultimate productivity companion, at Build 2023. Dev Home is a new experience for developers on Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools such as GitHub. Today, Dev Home is getting even better for you.
<h3><strong>Dev Home now has Azure DevOps extension so you can stay on top of your daily tasks</strong></h3>
We are thrilled to release Dev Home v0.7 with Azure DevOps (ADO) support powered by the new Dev Home Azure extension. This extension allows you to easily clone your Azure repositories using Dev Home to get your machine to a code-ready state, manage your ADO projects and get productive right away from the Windows desktop. Additionally, you can pin ADO widgets to display query results and query tiles to provide easily glanceable information for the projects you care about most. Enterprises can take advantage of Dev Home to onboard new team members and projects faster and developers can stay on top of projects, queries and relevant tasks from Dev Home.

With our focus on empowering every developer to be an AI developer and continued investments on developer productivity, we believe Windows now provides the best platform for you to jumpstart local AI development and create cutting edge experiences for your customers. We are humbled and excited to be on this journey with you.

We love hearing from our developer community and want to continue working with you to build the experiences and features you want.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[At Inspire this year we <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">talked</a> about how developers will be able to run Llama 2 on Windows with DirectML and the ONNX Runtime and we've been hard at work to make this a reality.

We now have a sample showing our progress with Llama 2 7B!

See <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2</a>

This sample relies on first doing an optimization pass on the model with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models. Olive utilizes powerful graph fusion optimizations from ONNX Runtime and a model architecture optimized for DirectML to speed up inference times by up to <strong>10X</strong>!

After this optimization pass, Llama 2 7B runs fast enough that you can have a conversation in real time on multiple vendors’ hardware!

We’ve also built a little UI to make it easy to see the optimized model in action.

Thank you to our hardware partners who helped make this happen. For more on how Llama 2 lights up on our partners’ hardware with DirectML see:

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many developers believe creating apps for <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/arm/">Windows on Arm</a> is difficult, but developing for Arm is easier than you think, and Microsoft is here to help! It is my pleasure to announce a new <a href="https://aka.ms/AppAssure">App Assure</a> Arm Advisory Service to help developers build Arm-optimized apps. This service is in addition to our existing promise: your apps will run on Windows on Arm, and if you encounter any issues, Microsoft will help you remediate them. Most apps just work under emulation, and developers can port their apps to run natively with minimal effort. More device manufacturers are building Arm devices for a reason – devices are lightweight, have lightning-fast connectivity, offer extended battery life, and have advanced camera and audio capabilities in addition to many other benefits. These benefits can drive increased customer adoption of Arm devices which is driving more ISVs to develop Arm-optimized versions of their applications, as shown in the section below. In a nutshell, the Arm ecosystem is quickly expanding.

According to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/arm-based-pcs-to-nearly-double-market-share-by-2027/">Counterpoint</a>, Arm market share will almost double from 14% to 25% by 2027. This means that app compatibility for Windows on Arm is essential to the continued viability of your apps! While we’re officially announcing the Arm Advisory Service today, we have been helping developers make Arm-optimized apps for over three years. We have partnered with developers to share tips and best practices and we are making substantial investments and growing our developer support. For example, our Arm Advisory Service has already helped ISVs in areas of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and anti-malware product suites on Arm by providing code samples, code reviews, sharing development best practices and debugging help. This Arm development assistance is key to enabling ISVs to optimize their applications for Arm.
<h3>Advisory Services Program Features</h3>
Our Arm Advisory Service is a no-cost engineering advisory program designed to help developers build Arm-optimized apps. Key benefits of this program include:
<ul>
 	<li>Technical workshop for development best-practices, guidance and implementation questions</li>
 	<li>Suggestions regarding platform features to enhance the Arm application experience</li>
 	<li>Code samples and reviews to enable Arm development</li>
 	<li>Break-fix assistance with issues that arise when porting or building Arm apps</li>
 	<li>Escalation path to Microsoft engineers to assist with software development and provide product feedback</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back at <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/">Build ‘23 in May</a>, we announced a host of new experiences with a renewed focus on developer productivity and performance. We are now pleased to share with you that features like Dev Home, Dev Drive, WinGet and improvements to Taskbar, File Explorer and many more will start to become generally available with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178424">latest Windows 11 update</a>. We also have exciting news to share about the developer tools you already know and love: Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Terminal.

At Build in May ’23, we announced a new home for developers on Windows – Dev Home. With the latest Windows 11 update, Dev Home is now available as part of the OS, making developer features a key component of Windows 11. Today we are excited to announce a new PC setup experience for developers.
<h3><strong>A new PC setup experience for developers on Windows 11</strong></h3>
For the first time in Windows, you will be able to identify as a developer during your initial PC setup and Windows will customize your install experience catering to your workloads. To do this, select the "Development" intent on the "Let's customize your experience" page during setup. Once you set up your PC with “Development” intent it is easier to get all the benefits of Dev Home.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56856 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Developer-Intent_hi-res-1024x576.png" alt="Development intent screen" width="1024" height="576" />
<h3><strong>Dev Home: Your productivity companion</strong></h3>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home</a> is a new experience for developers in Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages, or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools (such as GitHub). It also helps you create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/">Dev Drive</a> for performant storage - all in one place. Dev Home also provides a customizable dashboard to help you monitor both your system and dev projects. We are releasing Dev Home v0.5 alongside the latest Windows 11 update to provide even more functionality like managing your extensions. We are adding a new extensions page on Dev Home, available now, that helps you discover and manage your Dev Home extensions, giving you the control to enhance and personalize your experience. With this addition, the Dev Home GitHub Extension will no longer be automatically installed. For more information see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home for Windows Developers | Microsoft Learn.</a>
<h3><strong>Unattended and reliable dev machine setup: Reducing set up time from days to hours</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced WinGet Configuration, a fast and reliable mechanism to help developers get ready to code in just a few clicks. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/configuration/">WinGet Configuration</a> is now stable and no longer requires enabling experimental features. To help you get started we have several <a href="https://aka.ms/dsc.yaml">samples</a> that you can try, and several GitHub repos now include configuration files to help you quickly install the tools to build the source code.  For example:

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">vscode/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/vscode (github.com)</a>

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">PowerToys/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/PowerToys (github.com)</a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56854 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Configure.jpg" alt="WinGet Configuration code" width="994" height="562" />

WinGet 1.6 makes its debut with several exciting new capabilities. Support for dependencies is now available. Packages that were previously blocked from submission can now be added to our catalog.

WinGet 1.6 introduces the new `winget download` command which allows you to download installers. This feature enables IT professionals to access packages from the community repository and make them available to their enterprise customers.

<h3><strong>Dev Drive: A new storage volume tailor-made for developers: supercharged for performance and security</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced Dev Drive – a new type of storage volume, tailor-made for developers, with a file system that delivers both performance and security. Starting today, Dev Drive will be available for all developers on Windows with the latest Windows 11 update.

Dev Drive is based on the Resilient File System (ReFS), which, combined with a new performance mode capability in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus, offers up to 30% file system improvement in build times for file I/O scenarios. To reap the benefits of Dev Drive, we recommend moving your package caches and repositories to Dev Drive(s). <a href="https://aka.ms/devdrive">Learn more</a>.

In addition, to quickly view the status of your Dev Drive volumes, the “For Developers settings page” now has a new Dev Drive section. The section also provides deep links to Disk &amp; Volume settings to create a Dev Drive and launch the Windows Security app to control antivirus behavior.
<h3><strong>Performance mode for Microsoft Defender </strong></h3>
Microsoft Defender Antivirus has released performance mode that provides asynchronous scanning on Dev Drive volumes. Behavior can be controlled via the new improved UI for Dev Drive <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">  </span> in the Microsoft Security app under “Virus &amp; threat protection”. If you have multiple Dev Drives, you can now quickly identify which one is in “Performance mode”.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56849 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_02-1024x900.png" alt="Virus and threat protection settings" width="1024" height="900" />

Upon clicking on “See volumes”, you can view all your Dev Drives. In this example below, we have two Dev Drives; (D:\) and (F:\) are both formatted in ReFS but Defender Performance Mode has been enabled only on (F:\).

<strong> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-56848 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_03-1024x407.png" alt="Dev Drive protection screen" width="1024" height="407" /></strong>
<h3><strong>Reducing toil and unlocking the fun and joy of developing on Windows with new improvements</strong></h3>
The team has listened closely to what is top of mind for you, including improvements to the Taskbar that we announced at Build back in May. Starting today, all these improvements will become available in the stable version with the latest Windows 11 update.
<ol>
 	<li>You can now quickly identify and access any instance of each app housed in the taskbar with just one click. All instances of the app are ungrouped with labels on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can now hide your Time and Date with a setting on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can quickly and easily shut down applications with a simple right-click on the app directly from the taskbar without opening the Task Manager. This setting can be enabled within the Developer settings page to then have “End task” appear within the context menu when you right-click on the icon within taskbar.</li>
 	<li>For Developers settings page has moved from “Privacy &amp; Security” to System. This provides a quick and easily discoverable entry point to developer settings.</li>
 	<li>You can now get improved performance of archive functionality during compression on Windows. We have added native support for additional archive formats, including tar, 7-zip, rar, gz and many others using the libarchive open-source project.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>File Explorer is getting even better </strong></h3>
We have introduced new functionality and collection control in WinUI3. ItemsView collection control offers LinedFlowLayout and Island functionality provides an easy way to adopt WinUI3 look and feel in any part of your app without having to change your entire application. File Explorer now runs on WinUI3 and has introduced several new features like Gallery powered by ItemsView and Island functionality, making it easy to access your photo collection. You can also now bring these new WinUI3 capabilities to your apps and offer a rich user experience to your customers.

In addition, we have also added multi-threading capabilities to File Explorer to greatly improve the performance of copy, move, recycle, and delete actions. Large operations should see significant improvements in the calculating phase as well as the actual file operation. As noted in our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/26/delivering-delightful-performance-for-more-than-one-billion-users-worldwide/">May 2023 blog</a>, these changes show over 40% improvements in bulk delete operations, giving time back to developers.
<h2><strong>Tools you know and love are getting even better and smarter </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>New and exciting – Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input and Web Search features are coming to Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview</strong></h3>
With the Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview we are introducing several new features such as the Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input, and Web Search. The Suggestions UI is a new UI element in Windows Terminal that provides text suggestions to the user. These suggestions can come from recently run commands, saved commands, and more.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56853 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/SuggestionsUI.gif" alt="Suggestions user experience" width="994" height="589" />

Broadcast Input allows users to broadcast their input from one Terminal pane to another Terminal pane in real time. Broadcast Input was a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2634">popular feature request</a> from our community members, and we are thrilled to delight our developers with this exciting feature.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56851 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/BroadcastInput.gif" alt="Broadcast input experience" width="1338" height="717" />

Web Search was a community contribution. When the right-click context menu is enabled, users will have a new option to do a web search on highlighted text. Web Search will default to Bing, and we are providing control to developers to change the default to the search engine of their choice.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56852 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/WebSearch.gif" alt="Web Search user experience" width="1914" height="560" data-wp-editing="1" />
<h3><strong>Introducing experimental features in Windows Terminal Canary</strong></h3>
Windows Terminal is distributed in a variety of formats. We are thrilled to announce that we are adding Windows Terminal Canary to the Windows Terminal family. Windows Terminal Canary is a new canary build of Windows Terminal that includes “hot off the presses” experimental features (including our AI chat feature).

New builds of Windows Terminal Canary are available nightly. This is the least stable channel of Windows Terminal, so you may be the first to discover bugs that no one else has before. If you are eager for the latest bits, then this is the build for you!
<h3><strong>New experimental features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - Auto Memory reclaim, new networking mode and more</strong></h3>
The <a href="http://www.github.com/microsoft/wsl/releases">latest release of WSL</a> brings access to new experimental features and some important quality and bug fixes! We’ve added new experimental features that you <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">can opt-in to using</a>, so you can get early access to WSL improvements that we are investigating making default in the future. This includes having the WSL VM automatically shrink in memory size when you’re not using it, setting your WSL virtual hard disks to be sparse so they will automatically shrink in disk size and conserve your disk space, as well as Hyper-V firewall which allows your Windows firewall rules to affect your WSL distros, and an entirely new networking mode that improves network compatibility, adds IPv6 support and more! Additionally, there are other bug fixes such as you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/9231">now run WSL in session 0,</a> WSL GUI apps have Windows snapping support with the keyboard, and more! To see a full list of WSL changes please <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">see this blog post</a>.

We continue to invest in driving developer productivity, convenience and performance with every update, and we are excited to share these features and experiences with you. To learn more and keep up to date with the latest news please visit <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Windows Dev Center</a>. We also love hearing from you, and we want to continue to work with our developer community to build the experiences and features you want.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Windows PCs require a restart to apply each month’s security updates. Today we’re offering tips and best practices that can help you make sure your applications seamlessly resume after a restart and keep your app users happy.

Some users manage Windows updates (and restarts) for themselves. Others prefer that their PCs automatically restart when not in use. In either case, users typically prefer to find their applications exactly as they left them after an update. Their flow on Windows is more productive and fun when apps restore their state, position and pending operations following an update.

What does this mean for you as an application developer? If your app is documentation-focused, you might want to help people remember where in the document they were editing most recently. If your app helps people modify images, consider saving their “undo” stack and/or creating a temporary copy of their workspace. For game developers, it might be helpful to implement a quick “save” and ask players where they would like to resume. Ultimately, your apps can offer seamless continuity following a restart – for updates or otherwise – by following a few best practices:
<ul>
 	<li>Save the user’s state.</li>
 	<li>Remember how their previous views were positioned.</li>
 	<li>Relaunch the app following the update.</li>
</ul>
In this post, we will explore native APIs you can use to help you save an app user’s work and resume an app state following a restart.
<h2>Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps</h2>
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) provides <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle">lifecycle management capabilities</a> to applications. While a UWP app doesn’t need anything special to be restarted and resumed after a system update, it is recommended to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle#save-your-state">save the app state<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span></a> periodically.
<h2>Win32 apps</h2>
If you are developing a Windows desktop app, you can use the Application Recovery and Restart (ARR) APIs to register your app for restart. Specifically, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">registering for restart</a> helps applications cleanly close upon system restart and relaunch after restart with pre-defined arguments.

Whether you are building Win32 apps or you’re using Windows app SDK, you can find <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cpp-winui-packaged">ARR API usage samples on GitHub</a>.

In addition to registering apps for restart, you should consider how an app can best resume its previous workload and recover the previous state. Common strategies include saving often to disk and providing context to resume state in the arguments used when registering via ARR API. Here is a code example:
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">// Register for restart with the current value of app text box

RegisterApplicationRestart(counterTextBlock().Text().c_str(), 0);

// Update registration before crash with the new value of the app counter text box

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK([](PVOID recoveryData){


     BOOL canceled;

     if (SUCCEEDED(ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(&amp;canceled)) &amp;&amp; !canceled)

     {

          const auto counter = static_cast&lt;uint32_t*&gt;(recoveryData);

          RegisterApplicationRestart(to_hstring(*counter).c_str(), 0);
     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return (DWORD)0;

     }), &amp;_counter, RECOVERY_DEFAULT_PING_INTERVAL, 0);</pre>
<h2>.NET apps</h2>
Similar to Win32 apps, .NET apps can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">register</a> for restart by using the ARR APIs. The only difference is using <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32">p/Invoke</a> to wrap the native API calls. You can find .NET sample code using ARR APIs <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cs-winui-packaged">on GitHub</a>.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

// Best effort to register recovery callback to update restart arguments with the latest seconds counter value.

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(new APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK(p =&gt;

{

     ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(out BOOL canceled);

     if (!canceled)

     {

          RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return 0;

}), null, 5000, 0);</pre>
Apps with critical workloads can use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate">power APIs</a> to keep the system running and prevent a restart, but this isn’t permanent. Both users and administrators need devices to stay secure and a system will eventually be forced to restart after an update. Further, keeping the system powered on can drain battery or use excess power.

We encourage you to read more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate#remarks">how to effectively use Power APIs</a> for system services and long-running critical applications.
<h2>Share your feedback</h2>
Have suggestions or ideas for API improvement? Still have questions about how your app and Windows Update can work together? Please share your thoughts by submitting them via Feedback Hub (Windows key + F)!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce the public preview launch of Win32 app isolation. This blog post provides an overview of the topic. To learn more about the developer experience and engage with the team, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

It is worth noting that Win32 app isolation is an addition to the family of existing Windows sandbox options, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox</a> and<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview"> Microsoft Defender Application Guard</a>. While these options are based on virtualization based security, Win32 app isolation is built on the foundation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> (and more). <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> are specifically designed to encapsulate and restrict the execution of processes, helping to ensure they operate with limited privileges, commonly referred to as low integrity levels.
<h3>Win32 App isolation</h3>
The frequency and impact of zero-day vulnerabilities have witnessed a substantial increase over the years. Attackers frequently focus their attention on popular applications, exploiting either unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities. That's why we strongly advocate for the integration of preventive and containment measures.

To this end, we propose using the combined power of Win32 app isolation and cutting-edge technologies like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/smart-app-control/overview">Smart App Control</a>, which together work to effectively block untrusted applications and limit damage if trusted apps are compromised. By implementing this approach, a robust security strategy can be established, significantly mitigating the potential harm caused by zero-day attacks.

Win32 app isolation is a new security feature designed to be the default isolation standard on Windows clients. It is built on<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer"> AppContainers</a> and offers several added security features to help windows platform defend against attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in the application (this could be 3P libraries as well). To isolate their apps, application developers can update their applications using the tools provided by Microsoft. For more information on Win32 app Isolation developer experience, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56813 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure1-LayeredApproach-1024x545.png" alt="Diagram showing how preventive and containment strategies can be applied." width="1024" height="545" />

<em>Figure 1: Combining Preventive and Containment Strategies.</em>

Another benefit of isolation is to safeguard end-user privacy choices in the event of a breach. When a Win32 app runs with the same privilege as the user, it is possible to allow itself access to user’s information without the user's consent. Consequently, there is a risk of unauthorized access to the user's privacy data by malicious actors without their knowledge or consent.
<h3>Goals of Win32 app isolation</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-56814 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure2-Objectives-1024x449.png" alt="Diagram showing goals of Win32 app isolation" width="1024" height="449" />

<em>Figure 2: Key objectives of Win32 app isolation</em>

<strong>Limit damage</strong>: Win32 app isolation achieves its goal of limiting impact (in the event apps are compromised) by running apps with low privilege, which requires a multi-step attack to break out of the container. Attackers must target a specific capability or vulnerability, compared to having broad access and since the attack must be directed at a specific vulnerability, mitigation patches can be quickly applied, reducing the shelf life of the attack.

<strong>Reduce developer effort</strong>: To reduce the effort required for developers to update their apps, Microsoft provides developer tools and experiences, with a focus on the MSIX packaging tool and the Application Capability Profiler.

<strong>Seamless user experience</strong>: Finally, while the focus is on security, it is critical that security decisions are not delegated to end-users via cryptic security prompts, and application compatibility is maintained.
<h3>Limit damage</h3>
The protection offered by Win32 App isolation follows a two-step process. In the first step, the Win32 application is launched as a low integrity process using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>, which is recognized as a security boundary by Microsoft. Consequently, the process is limited to a specific set of Windows APIs by default and is unable to inject code into any process operating at a higher integrity level.

In the second step, the least privilege is enforced by granting authorized access to Windows securable objects. This access is determined by capabilities that are added to the application manifest through MSIX packaging. Securable objects in this context refer to Windows resources whose access is safeguarded by capabilities. These capabilities serve as a means to implement a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists">Discretionary Access Control List </a>on Windows.
<h3>Reduce developer effort</h3>
To help ensure that isolated applications run smoothly, developers must define the access requirements for the application via access capability declarations in the application package manifest.

The Application Capability Profiler <strong>(ACP</strong>) simplifies the entire process by allowing the application to run in "learn-mode" with low privileges. Instead of failing access if the capability is not present, ACP allows access <strong>and logs additional capabilities required for access if the application were to run isolated</strong>.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56815" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure3-Overview-of-ACP-1024x340.png" alt="Diagram showing the different steps involved in profiling your Win32 app" width="1024" height="340" />

<em>Figure 3: Overview of Application Capability Profiler</em>

Under the hood, <strong>ACP</strong> uses the Windows Performance Analyzer data layer backend (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer">WPA</a>) and parses Event Trace Logs (<strong>ETL</strong>) to provide a list of additional capabilities needed. ETLs are detailed and verbose, and ACP parses them to output missing capabilities as a file. Once the capabilities are output, they can simply be included in the application package manifest.

Finally, ACP provides a WPA profile file “<em>ACP-StackTrace.wpaProfile”</em> that allows the user to easily configure WPA to inspect the event trace logs captured (in learn-mode) for relevant call stack information. In most cases, call stack analysis using WPA is not required.

For more information on <strong>ACP</strong>, please refer to the Github documentation page, linked <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/profiler/application-capability-profiler.md#stack-tracing---acp-stacktracewpaprofile">here</a>.
<h3>Seamless user experience</h3>
To create a smooth user experience that aligns with non-isolated/native Win32 applications, two key factors should be taken into consideration, as outlined below. The first factor relates to implementing methods to manage access to files and privacy information within and outside the isolation boundary (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>). The second factor involves integrating Win32 apps with other Windows interfaces in a way that helps enable seamless functionality without causing perplexing user consent prompts. Now, let's explore these factors in greater detail:
<ol>
 	<li>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information;</li>
 	<li>Integrating Win32 Apps for compatibility with other Windows interfaces;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information.</h3>
Access to a user's private data, such as camera, microphone, location, images, files, or folders, is not permitted without the user's permission. However, the app may require access to certain program files, such as .NET libraries or protected registry keys. Asking for permission to access user folders is intuitive, but asking for permission to access program files and registry keys can be confusing for users. This confusion can be exploited by a compromised Win32 app to trick the user into allowing access to a registry key or sensitive file, which can then be used to escape the sandbox.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56816" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure4-Managing-User-Consent-1024x484.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods to reduce unnecessary prompts presented to user" width="1024" height="484" />

<em>Figure 4: Effectively managing user consents.</em>

To help prevent unauthorized access, several instrumentations have been built. Win32 apps need to explicitly include the “<em>isolatedWin32-promptForAccess</em>” capability and declare their intent to support prompting. Apps that do not require access to user's data outside the app can opt out of any kind of user prompting for consent. Note, this capability only allows control over filesystem access, access to privacy related information such as camera, location and microphone shall always prompt.

Let us now discuss approaches on how user consents are obtained. User prompts are displayed when user consent is required, and the context of the prompt should be meaningful to the end user, such as accessing the user's documents or camera. The other way to grant consent to files is via user selection such as when the user selects a file via the file dialog or by right clicking the context menu.

When the user grants consent to a specific file for the isolated application, the isolated application interfaces with Windows <strong>Brokering File System</strong> (BFS) and grants access to the files via a mini filter driver. BFS simply opens the file and serves as the interface between the isolated application and BFS.

File and registry virtualization helps ensure that apps continue to work while not updating the base file or registry. This also minimizes any user experience friction while maintaining application compatibility. Protected namespaces are created to allow access only to the app and do not require user consent. For example, access to a folder that has a property only known to the Win32 app and required for app compatibility can be granted.
<h3>Integrations with Win32 app isolation for compatibility</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56817" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Picture5-MaintainingAppCompat-1024x509.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods applied to maintain app compatibility." width="1024" height="509" />

<em>Figure 5: Maintaining app compatibility with isolation.</em>

In order to achieve a high level of similarity and feature parity between isolated and non-isolated Win32 applications, certain allowances have been made. Specifically, Win32 apps operating with low privileges (referred to as low integrity level) are permitted to interact with file systems and various APIs. For example, interactions involving File Type Associations, including the "open with" option, COM servers, and file drag and drop, are facilitated through BFS (File System Broker).

Furthermore, capabilities included in the application manifest enable interactions with other Windows components, such as shell notifications and system tray icons. This ensures that these functionalities can be utilized without compromising the security of these applications.
<h3>What’s Next!</h3>
To summarize, Win32 app isolation enhances security for Windows clients by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a> and additional security controls (as described above) to help reduce the risk of damage from compromised applications and help safeguard user privacy. The approach enforces least privilege through added capabilities and employs various strategies to help prevent unauthorized access, while minimizing developer effort and maintaining application compatibility.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to introduce Dev Drive! A new storage volume optimized for developer workloads that delivers performance, security, and control. Dev Drive is built on the Resilient File System (ReFS) and combined with the new performance mode capability of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, provides up to 30% better performance for overall build times compared to current, in-market Windows 11 (22H2).
<h3><strong>Performance and Security </strong></h3>
We received feedback from developers that slow file io performance was disruptive to their workflow. In response, we analyzed the file system to understand where the bottlenecks were. Benchmarks were created across multiple end-to-end developer scenarios and across multiple languages. We then made optimizations to the file system and introduced a new performance capability for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Now available in public preview, this new capability provides asynchronous scanning on a Dev Drive and does not change the security posture of your system drive or other drives  Asynchronous scanning provides improved security compared to traditional folder and process exclusions which are often used by developers. As a result, Dev Drive improves overall build performance, most notably in heavy file io based scenarios. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-antivirus-performance-mode?view=o365-worldwide">Protecting Dev Drive using performance mode</a>.
<h3><strong>Control</strong></h3>
Beyond simply providing faster performance, the purpose of Dev Drive is to give control back to you, the developer. While there are specific configurations that Microsoft generally recommends, and have used as defaults, we have also created tools for you to further customize it. For example, administrators on the device can modify the behavior of filter manager to allow which filters are attached. You may wish to use additional filter drivers for app compat reasons, or if you have a different security posture, you can gain more performance by removing filters.

<strong>Including new, easier UX</strong>

Previously the “Disk Management” tool was used to set up and maintain disks. Now we have the same functionality with the modern Settings app. You can do everything you need to do to create a Dev Drive, including creating a new volume, creating & attaching a VHD, shrinking or expanding disk sizes, and creating partitions, all in one place.

Here is the new Disks & Volumes UI to support creating a Dev Drive and VHD scenarios.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56806 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-05-30-135009.png" alt="" width="691" height="273" />

<strong>Guidance</strong>

<strong> </strong>We recommend placing your working directories, repositories, and package caches on a <a href="http://aka.ms/devdrive">Dev Drive</a>. We are working with partners to fully take advantage of Dev Drive by default, see our partner blogs for <a href="https://aka.ms/vsdevdrive">Visual Studio and Dev Box</a> along with other features such as <a href="https://aka.ms/EngMSDevDrive">Copy on Write.</a> And our own documentation at aka.ms/devdrive for full configuration guidance.

Since Dev Drive only enables a minimal set of filter drivers, any applications or features that depend on those filters will not work on a Dev Drive. For that reason we do not support all apps being installed on a Dev Drive. Developers should test their scenarios, and if needed, enable additional filters or keep their tools installed on another drive.
<h3><strong>Benchmarks</strong></h3>
<strong>How we tested</strong>

Our testing plan while creating Dev Drive was two-fold:
<ol>
 	<li>Build out automatic performance tests that would run on a build-by-build cadence</li>
 	<li>Test and profile our end-to-end scenarios regularly</li>
</ol>
We added automatic performance tests to our build labs to ensure that we had measurements tracking our performance for each build. We used the full git suite (clone, commit, etc.) in the lab. These tests enabled us to watch the progression of git clone performance, for example, build over build. Not only were we watching to ensure the speed of a single git clone operation was trending down, but we were also watching to see if any regressions were checked in by the development team for Dev Drive, or other feature teams working on similar components of the Windows OS.

<strong>Validation and investigation testing</strong>

To further test, validate and profile key developer workloads we’ve built a set of synthetic benchmarks which cover various workloads like Python, Node, .NET, and Java. We’ve worked with the Storage & File Systems and Defender teams to take traces, validate the improvements and find opportunities for further refinement to the file system and Defender.

For these tests we created a consistent hardware setup using a Surface Laptop 4 to compare the default Windows 11 22H2 configuration with Defender enabled, against the latest builds with Dev Drive. We used common public repos and basic scenarios, a few of which are:
<ul>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore">Orchard Core</a> project using .NET</li>
 	<li>Run <a href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/tests">django tests</a></li>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework">Spring Framework</a> project using Gradle</li>
 	<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node</a> repo using Git</li>
</ul>
<strong>Results</strong>

<strong> </strong>As you can see, every scenario benefits differently from the optimizations. Scenarios that are more file io heavy benefit the most from Dev Drive.

<h3><strong>Welcome to the Journey!</strong></h3>
This is just the start of improvements to come. The Windows ecosystem consists of a wide variety of hardware configurations, with each configuration comes varied performance results. We invite you to help us test Dev Drive to ensure the product is impactful for the scenarios that matter most to you. Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us. We are excited for you to try out your developer scenarios on your hardware configuration and leave us feedback through Feedback Hub under the Dev Drive context.
