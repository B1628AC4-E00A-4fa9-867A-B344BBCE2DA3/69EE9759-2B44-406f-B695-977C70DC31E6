]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce the public preview launch of Win32 app isolation. This blog post provides an overview of the topic. To learn more about the developer experience and engage with the team, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

It is worth noting that Win32 app isolation is an addition to the family of existing Windows sandbox options, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox</a> and<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview"> Microsoft Defender Application Guard</a>. While these options are based on virtualization based security, Win32 app isolation is built on the foundation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> (and more). <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> are specifically designed to encapsulate and restrict the execution of processes, helping to ensure they operate with limited privileges, commonly referred to as low integrity levels.
<h3>Win32 App isolation</h3>
The frequency and impact of zero-day vulnerabilities have witnessed a substantial increase over the years. Attackers frequently focus their attention on popular applications, exploiting either unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities. That's why we strongly advocate for the integration of preventive and containment measures.

To this end, we propose using the combined power of Win32 app isolation and cutting-edge technologies like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/smart-app-control/overview">Smart App Control</a>, which together work to effectively block untrusted applications and limit damage if trusted apps are compromised. By implementing this approach, a robust security strategy can be established, significantly mitigating the potential harm caused by zero-day attacks.

Win32 app isolation is a new security feature designed to be the default isolation standard on Windows clients. It is built on<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer"> AppContainers</a> and offers several added security features to help windows platform defend against attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in the application (this could be 3P libraries as well). To isolate their apps, application developers can update their applications using the tools provided by Microsoft. For more information on Win32 app Isolation developer experience, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56813 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure1-LayeredApproach-1024x545.png" alt="Diagram showing how preventive and containment strategies can be applied." width="1024" height="545" />

<em>Figure 1: Combining Preventive and Containment Strategies.</em>

Another benefit of isolation is to safeguard end-user privacy choices in the event of a breach. When a Win32 app runs with the same privilege as the user, it is possible to allow itself access to user’s information without the user's consent. Consequently, there is a risk of unauthorized access to the user's privacy data by malicious actors without their knowledge or consent.
<h3>Goals of Win32 app isolation</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-56814 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure2-Objectives-1024x449.png" alt="Diagram showing goals of Win32 app isolation" width="1024" height="449" />

<em>Figure 2: Key objectives of Win32 app isolation</em>

<strong>Limit damage</strong>: Win32 app isolation achieves its goal of limiting impact (in the event apps are compromised) by running apps with low privilege, which requires a multi-step attack to break out of the container. Attackers must target a specific capability or vulnerability, compared to having broad access and since the attack must be directed at a specific vulnerability, mitigation patches can be quickly applied, reducing the shelf life of the attack.

<strong>Reduce developer effort</strong>: To reduce the effort required for developers to update their apps, Microsoft provides developer tools and experiences, with a focus on the MSIX packaging tool and the Application Capability Profiler.

<strong>Seamless user experience</strong>: Finally, while the focus is on security, it is critical that security decisions are not delegated to end-users via cryptic security prompts, and application compatibility is maintained.
<h3>Limit damage</h3>
The protection offered by Win32 App isolation follows a two-step process. In the first step, the Win32 application is launched as a low integrity process using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>, which is recognized as a security boundary by Microsoft. Consequently, the process is limited to a specific set of Windows APIs by default and is unable to inject code into any process operating at a higher integrity level.

In the second step, the least privilege is enforced by granting authorized access to Windows securable objects. This access is determined by capabilities that are added to the application manifest through MSIX packaging. Securable objects in this context refer to Windows resources whose access is safeguarded by capabilities. These capabilities serve as a means to implement a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists">Discretionary Access Control List </a>on Windows.
<h3>Reduce developer effort</h3>
To help ensure that isolated applications run smoothly, developers must define the access requirements for the application via access capability declarations in the application package manifest.

The Application Capability Profiler <strong>(ACP</strong>) simplifies the entire process by allowing the application to run in "learn-mode" with low privileges. Instead of failing access if the capability is not present, ACP allows access <strong>and logs additional capabilities required for access if the application were to run isolated</strong>.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56815" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure3-Overview-of-ACP-1024x340.png" alt="Diagram showing the different steps involved in profiling your Win32 app" width="1024" height="340" />

<em>Figure 3: Overview of Application Capability Profiler</em>

Under the hood, <strong>ACP</strong> uses the Windows Performance Analyzer data layer backend (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer">WPA</a>) and parses Event Trace Logs (<strong>ETL</strong>) to provide a list of additional capabilities needed. ETLs are detailed and verbose, and ACP parses them to output missing capabilities as a file. Once the capabilities are output, they can simply be included in the application package manifest.

Finally, ACP provides a WPA profile file “<em>ACP-StackTrace.wpaProfile”</em> that allows the user to easily configure WPA to inspect the event trace logs captured (in learn-mode) for relevant call stack information. In most cases, call stack analysis using WPA is not required.

For more information on <strong>ACP</strong>, please refer to the Github documentation page, linked <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/profiler/application-capability-profiler.md#stack-tracing---acp-stacktracewpaprofile">here</a>.
<h3>Seamless user experience</h3>
To create a smooth user experience that aligns with non-isolated/native Win32 applications, two key factors should be taken into consideration, as outlined below. The first factor relates to implementing methods to manage access to files and privacy information within and outside the isolation boundary (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>). The second factor involves integrating Win32 apps with other Windows interfaces in a way that helps enable seamless functionality without causing perplexing user consent prompts. Now, let's explore these factors in greater detail:
<ol>
 	<li>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information;</li>
 	<li>Integrating Win32 Apps for compatibility with other Windows interfaces;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information.</h3>
Access to a user's private data, such as camera, microphone, location, images, files, or folders, is not permitted without the user's permission. However, the app may require access to certain program files, such as .NET libraries or protected registry keys. Asking for permission to access user folders is intuitive, but asking for permission to access program files and registry keys can be confusing for users. This confusion can be exploited by a compromised Win32 app to trick the user into allowing access to a registry key or sensitive file, which can then be used to escape the sandbox.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56816" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure4-Managing-User-Consent-1024x484.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods to reduce unnecessary prompts presented to user" width="1024" height="484" />

<em>Figure 4: Effectively managing user consents.</em>

To help prevent unauthorized access, several instrumentations have been built. Win32 apps need to explicitly include the “<em>isolatedWin32-promptForAccess</em>” capability and declare their intent to support prompting. Apps that do not require access to user's data outside the app can opt out of any kind of user prompting for consent. Note, this capability only allows control over filesystem access, access to privacy related information such as camera, location and microphone shall always prompt.

Let us now discuss approaches on how user consents are obtained. User prompts are displayed when user consent is required, and the context of the prompt should be meaningful to the end user, such as accessing the user's documents or camera. The other way to grant consent to files is via user selection such as when the user selects a file via the file dialog or by right clicking the context menu.

When the user grants consent to a specific file for the isolated application, the isolated application interfaces with Windows <strong>Brokering File System</strong> (BFS) and grants access to the files via a mini filter driver. BFS simply opens the file and serves as the interface between the isolated application and BFS.

File and registry virtualization helps ensure that apps continue to work while not updating the base file or registry. This also minimizes any user experience friction while maintaining application compatibility. Protected namespaces are created to allow access only to the app and do not require user consent. For example, access to a folder that has a property only known to the Win32 app and required for app compatibility can be granted.
<h3>Integrations with Win32 app isolation for compatibility</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56817" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Picture5-MaintainingAppCompat-1024x509.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods applied to maintain app compatibility." width="1024" height="509" />

<em>Figure 5: Maintaining app compatibility with isolation.</em>

In order to achieve a high level of similarity and feature parity between isolated and non-isolated Win32 applications, certain allowances have been made. Specifically, Win32 apps operating with low privileges (referred to as low integrity level) are permitted to interact with file systems and various APIs. For example, interactions involving File Type Associations, including the "open with" option, COM servers, and file drag and drop, are facilitated through BFS (File System Broker).

Furthermore, capabilities included in the application manifest enable interactions with other Windows components, such as shell notifications and system tray icons. This ensures that these functionalities can be utilized without compromising the security of these applications.
<h3>What’s Next!</h3>
To summarize, Win32 app isolation enhances security for Windows clients by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a> and additional security controls (as described above) to help reduce the risk of damage from compromised applications and help safeguard user privacy. The approach enforces least privilege through added capabilities and employs various strategies to help prevent unauthorized access, while minimizing developer effort and maintaining application compatibility.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to introduce Dev Drive! A new storage volume optimized for developer workloads that delivers performance, security, and control. Dev Drive is built on the Resilient File System (ReFS) and combined with the new performance mode capability of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, provides up to 30% better performance for overall build times compared to current, in-market Windows 11 (22H2).
<h3><strong>Performance and Security </strong></h3>
We received feedback from developers that slow file io performance was disruptive to their workflow. In response, we analyzed the file system to understand where the bottlenecks were. Benchmarks were created across multiple end-to-end developer scenarios and across multiple languages. We then made optimizations to the file system and introduced a new performance capability for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Now available in public preview, this new capability provides asynchronous scanning on a Dev Drive and does not change the security posture of your system drive or other drives  Asynchronous scanning provides improved security compared to traditional folder and process exclusions which are often used by developers. As a result, Dev Drive improves overall build performance, most notably in heavy file io based scenarios. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-antivirus-performance-mode?view=o365-worldwide">Protecting Dev Drive using performance mode</a>.
<h3><strong>Control</strong></h3>
Beyond simply providing faster performance, the purpose of Dev Drive is to give control back to you, the developer. While there are specific configurations that Microsoft generally recommends, and have used as defaults, we have also created tools for you to further customize it. For example, administrators on the device can modify the behavior of filter manager to allow which filters are attached. You may wish to use additional filter drivers for app compat reasons, or if you have a different security posture, you can gain more performance by removing filters.

<strong>Including new, easier UX</strong>

Previously the “Disk Management” tool was used to set up and maintain disks. Now we have the same functionality with the modern Settings app. You can do everything you need to do to create a Dev Drive, including creating a new volume, creating & attaching a VHD, shrinking or expanding disk sizes, and creating partitions, all in one place.

Here is the new Disks & Volumes UI to support creating a Dev Drive and VHD scenarios.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56806 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-05-30-135009.png" alt="" width="691" height="273" />

<strong>Guidance</strong>

<strong> </strong>We recommend placing your working directories, repositories, and package caches on a <a href="http://aka.ms/devdrive">Dev Drive</a>. We are working with partners to fully take advantage of Dev Drive by default, see our partner blogs for <a href="https://aka.ms/vsdevdrive">Visual Studio and Dev Box</a> along with other features such as <a href="https://aka.ms/EngMSDevDrive">Copy on Write.</a> And our own documentation at aka.ms/devdrive for full configuration guidance.

Since Dev Drive only enables a minimal set of filter drivers, any applications or features that depend on those filters will not work on a Dev Drive. For that reason we do not support all apps being installed on a Dev Drive. Developers should test their scenarios, and if needed, enable additional filters or keep their tools installed on another drive.
<h3><strong>Benchmarks</strong></h3>
<strong>How we tested</strong>

Our testing plan while creating Dev Drive was two-fold:
<ol>
 	<li>Build out automatic performance tests that would run on a build-by-build cadence</li>
 	<li>Test and profile our end-to-end scenarios regularly</li>
</ol>
We added automatic performance tests to our build labs to ensure that we had measurements tracking our performance for each build. We used the full git suite (clone, commit, etc.) in the lab. These tests enabled us to watch the progression of git clone performance, for example, build over build. Not only were we watching to ensure the speed of a single git clone operation was trending down, but we were also watching to see if any regressions were checked in by the development team for Dev Drive, or other feature teams working on similar components of the Windows OS.

<strong>Validation and investigation testing</strong>

To further test, validate and profile key developer workloads we’ve built a set of synthetic benchmarks which cover various workloads like Python, Node, .NET, and Java. We’ve worked with the Storage & File Systems and Defender teams to take traces, validate the improvements and find opportunities for further refinement to the file system and Defender.

For these tests we created a consistent hardware setup using a Surface Laptop 4 to compare the default Windows 11 22H2 configuration with Defender enabled, against the latest builds with Dev Drive. We used common public repos and basic scenarios, a few of which are:
<ul>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore">Orchard Core</a> project using .NET</li>
 	<li>Run <a href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/tests">django tests</a></li>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework">Spring Framework</a> project using Gradle</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the team that brought you Windows Terminal, Windows Subsystem for Linux, PowerToys and Windows Package Manager (WinGet), we are excited to introduce Dev Home, a new open-source experience in Windows created just for developers. Dev Home is a centralized location for setting up your machine, monitoring your system information, and managing your projects.

Dev Home is part of Windows and will update through the Microsoft Store and GitHub with continuous releases to add new features and improve quality. Today, you can install Dev Home (Preview) from the <a href="https://aka.ms/devhome">Microsoft Store</a> or from the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.
<h1>Dev Home at its core</h1>
Dev Home is designed with customization and configurability in mind. It's built as an open-source tool with an extension model to allow you to create your own customized Dev Home experience. Our team is striving to make Dev Home a great place for all developers and its extensibility can help make it tailored just for you.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56792 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/welcome-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />
<h1>Extensions</h1>
Extensions can provide their own experiences within the Dev Home and also provide widgets for the dashboard. If you'd like to learn how to create an extension for Dev Home, check out our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/blob/main/docs/extensions.md">docs</a>. In the future, we're looking to create a marketplace within Dev Home, to make finding and installing extensions that much easier. We welcome everyone and want to collaborate on how we can make Dev Home the best location for everyone.
<h2>Dev Home GitHub Extension</h2>
Dev Home comes with one extension installed by default: the <a href="https://aka.ms/devhomegithubextension">Dev Home GitHub extension</a>. This extension is also open source and has its own <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhomegithubextension">GitHub repo</a>. The Dev Home GitHub extension connects your GitHub account to Dev Home to provide GitHub integration right onto your desktop. This extension provides GitHub widgets for the Dev Home dashboard and repo suggestions for the machine configuration tool.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56793 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/github-setup-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />

To further enhance the extension ecosystem, we’re actively working on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/521">creating an Azure DevOps (ADO) extension</a> to provide similar functionality to the GitHub extension and give you even more control over your ADO projects. We are also pairing with Team Xbox to bring the public Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) to Dev Home to help you find many of the tools you need to set up a game development environment.
<h1>Machine configuration using Dev Home</h1>
One of the biggest pain points we've heard from developers is the time and hassle it takes to set up a dev environment to code for an existing project. We've included a new environment configuration tool to help make it easy to set up your local machine as well as a remote environment like a Dev Box or GitHub Codespaces.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56794 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/machine-config-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />
<h2>End-to-end setup</h2>
One way to get set up using Dev Home is through the end-to-end setup flow. This flow allows you to choose repositories to clone from your GitHub account or you can simply enter a URL. At this point in the flow, you can also choose to create a Dev Drive to clone your repositories to. After choosing repositories to clone, you can select applications to install. This page is powered by WinGet and acts as a GUI to help you install all the packages you need. Once you've chosen your repos and applications to install, you can click set up, and let Dev Home handle the rest for getting your machine ready for development.
<h2>WinGet configuration</h2>
Another option you can use for setting up your machine is WinGet’s new DSC configuration YAML files. These files can install applications, configure them, and more to help you achieve the desired state for your development environment. Dev Home provides the option to run these configuration files and see their output all within the setup tool. <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">To learn more about WinGet </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">configuration files, check out this </span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/winget-configuration-preview/"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">blog post</span></a><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">.</span>
<h1>Dashboard and widgets</h1>
Dev Home includes a customizable dashboard with developer-focused widgets built using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/widgets/">Windows widget platform</a>. Widgets we've shipped with this first release of Dev Home include system resource widgets with information based on your CPU, GPU, network, and memory usage. Additionally, the Dev Home GitHub extension provides GitHub widgets to display issue and pull request information based on a repository, plus issues and pull requests you've been mentioned in, assigned to, or have your review requested on. If you have more widgets you'd like to see, please file a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56795 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/dashboard.png" alt="" width="2496" height="1592" />
<h1>Creating Dev Drives using Dev Home</h1>
Dev Home makes it easy to set up Dev Drives when using the machine configuration tool. Dev Drives are a new storage volume option we've released to the Windows Insider Program for Microsoft Build. These drives use the Resilient File System, or ReFS, and they also run performance mode for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These modifications allow for up to a 30% performance improvement in file intensive scenarios like builds and package manager activities.
<h1>Dev Home and Windows</h1>
We are working to ensure Dev Home and Windows are integrated together seamlessly. Using the Windows Insiders Program, we will be exploring different ways to bring you the Dev Home experience. As part of Windows OOBE (out of box experience), you can now select “Development” as an option for how you plan to use your device. We will experiment with different experiences such as recommending Dev Home in Start to help you finish getting your machine into a code-ready state. To learn more about Dev Drive, check out <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/06/01/dev-drive-performance-security-and-control-for-developers/">this blog post</a>!
<h1>Let's enjoy the ride</h1>
We are so excited to have you on this journey with us to make Dev Home a great place for developers. If you want to learn more about Dev Home, feel free to check out our <a href="https://aka.ms/devhomedocs">docs site</a>. If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, feel free to file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>. If you have any questions or want to provide feedback, feel free to reach out to Kayla (<a href="https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft">@cinnamon_msft</a>) on Twitter. We hope you enjoy our very first release of Dev Home and we look forward to seeing you at our next one!]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past year, we have made major strides in improving fundamentals across Windows.  From enhancing Windows’ speed and reliability to optimizing the performance of its flagship applications to improving Window’s sustainability, we have been working diligently to deliver faster, more reliable, and more efficient computing experiences that our users love.

Among the highlights from the last year:
<ul>
 	<li>We improved frequently used shell interactions like Taskbar, Notifications, and Quick Settings by as much as 15%!</li>
 	<li>Getting users into productivity faster by improving the time it takes to get to the desktop by 10% and reducing the impact of startup apps by over 50%.</li>
 	<li>Making PCs more sustainable with our new Energy Recommendations and Carbon-Aware Windows Update. We see a 6% average reduction in energy consumption for the users who use the recommended energy settings</li>
 	<li>Windows 11 is the most reliable version of Windows ever, with recent updates continuing to improve reliability.</li>
 	<li>Microsoft Edge starts up faster than ever before and saves memory with features like Sleeping Tabs, which saves up to 83% of memory for background tabs.</li>
 	<li>The new Teams app for Windows is 2x faster while using half the resources.</li>
</ul>
Today, we’re going to give you a behind-the-scenes peek into how performance improvements are delivered!  Windows operates at a massive scale – with over one billion users and a rich PC ecosystem, and there are innumerable combinations of usage patterns, key apps, and hardware.  Windows is foundational to many products too, each with varying needs – it powers your PC, it is the host OS for Azure, and it is core to Xbox and HoloLens.  With Windows 11, we are also releasing more frequently, increasing the need to protect against regressions and shortening our cycle for driving improvements.  Thankfully, we have built infrastructure and tools that help us find, understand, and fix performance problems at the massive scale Windows operates at.
<h3>Delivering Performance at Scale</h3>
If you go back 10 years ago, life as a performance analyst in Windows was challenging!  We would develop an operating system for months before it was released to external users as a beta release, and then we responded to bugs that were filed by our users and partners.  When you received a bug indicating users had performance issues in some scenarios, we did not always have the information necessary to root cause the bug.  Reproducing the issue was often a challenge.  Once you have found and understood the issue, how do you know how common it is?  As you can imagine, this process was slow and cumbersome.  Fast forward to today, when it’s hard to even remember those days.

Today we have a richer, more comprehensive story to guarantee great performance.  It starts during the design phase, where teams define strong performance goals to ensure our products meet the needs of our users.  Significant research has gone into users’ expectations, and we rely on that research to guide our goal-setting for user interactions.  We call these “interaction classes”, and they help us set targets and ensure we have the right UX affordances for experiences, whether they’re a nearly instant interaction like opening the Start Menu or longer like deleting files.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56778 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-1-Interaction-Classes.png" alt="" width="967" height="354" />

During development, we protect performance with daily performance gates that measure key Windows performance indicators ranging from Windows UX experiences, application experiences, resume from standby/sleep, memory and storage, and more.  Every day, we run over one million machine hours of validation.  This helps protect our daily build quality and ensures that teams can be productive.  Once we complete selfhost and evaluate our performance measures on our own devices, we flight builds to our vibrant Windows Insider community who provides us rich feedback on quality issues they observe across a breadth of device configurations and use cases.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56779 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-2-By-the-numbers.png" alt="" width="975" height="345" />

<em><strong>Diagnostic data by the numbers: (1) Over 2.5 million cabs per day; (2) over 12 million performance traces per year; (3) over 70.4 billion scenario performance data points per year.</strong> </em>

The scale of feedback we receive, both through feedback and perf diagnostic data, is massive.  Over the past few years we have invested in capturing performance and other Windows quality measures via diagnostic data in addition to backend services to analyze the information we get and to identify issues.  For important scenarios, we can now see the distribution of the real-world performance observed by our users across our broad ecosystem of devices.  Performance is a spectrum, not one number, and what you experience on your system may be quite different from another user with different hardware, running different apps, and using their system differently.  Another key innovation for us is the ability to analyze traces at scale and find issues that are on the critical path of a scenario’s responsiveness. This is a rich tool that allows us to tease apart what is causing performance issues in traces – ranging from scenario-specific code, IO delays, all the way down to kernel level scheduling optimizations and even driver quality issues.
<h3>Deploying These Techniques to Ensure Delightful Experiences</h3>
<strong>Delivering a great Instant On experience (Resume from Modern Standby with Windows Hello)</strong>

With Windows 11, you can get back to productivity more quickly than ever with Windows Hello and Instant On.  Most laptops today use Modern Standby and Windows Hello to offer a password-less logon experience.  Our goal is to get you back to productivity in seconds, and our latest generation of Surface PCs, like the Surface Laptop 5 and Surface Pro 9 are 10% faster than the prior generations.  We were able to achieve this with performance improvements in silicon, camera drivers, display drivers, and the OS over the last few releases.

A responsive, fluid, and fast Windows experience requires great baseline performance <strong><em>and</em></strong> the ability to deliver that consistently.  The negative performance feedback we receive for Windows Hello is infrequent, but when it occurs, it is often due to longer times to unlock your device.  Here is a look at how Windows engineers improve the baseline performance and consistency for scenarios like Instant On.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Measurement</strong>: All performance analysis starts with adding code to emit diagnostic data events that can be used for measurement or identifying system resource usage. We rely heavily on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows">ETW</a> to measure daily results to ensure we prevent regressions prior to selfhost.</li>
 	<li><strong>Optimize the baseline</strong>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">We analyze ETW traces through automated trace analysis techniques using </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/trace-processing/overview">DataLayer</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in some cases, manually using </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer">Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In WPA, engineers deploy a range of analysis techniques from resource usage (like </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/cpu-analysis">CPU Analysis</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/optimizing-performance-and-responsiveness-exercise-3">critical path analysis</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to identify issues in software and hardware that can be optimized.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Optimize the distribution at scale</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Using the optics that engineering teams add to their features, we observe light weight performance data (e.g. overall time for Windows Hello face authentication) across a diversity of Windows hardware. From this data, we can see the gap between the 90th/95th/99th percentiles and more common cases at the 10th and 50th percentiles.</li>
 	<li>We then collect verbose performance diagnostics at scale from a smaller sample of Windows users across a diversity of hardware and Windows OS configurations.</li>
 	<li>We then leverage our automatic trace analysis techniques using resource usage and critical path analysis, to build a stack chart of performance issues across the distribution and their relative impact. This scale analysis helps us deeply understand the performance bottlenecks across a broad range of devices and helps us prioritize the most impactful opportunities.  This chart shows an example of this analysis for Windows Hello face authentication.</li>
 	<li>Finally, we double-check a set of the top performance traces in these buckets from the scale approach to confirm the insights from scale analysis and build a solution with engineering teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-56780 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-3-Windows-Hello-example.png" alt="" width="624" height="314" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Listen to customer feedback</strong>: Feedback from customers through channels like Feedback Hub help us identify areas where we need new optics or investigation outside of our current flow. For Instant On, our team monitors a few Feedback Hub categories and contexts like "Power and Battery >> Sleep" and "Security and Privacy >> Windows Hello Face." When customers "Add more details" in Feedback Hub by reproducing and hitting "Record my issue," we have the rich data necessary to diagnose problems effectively.</li>
</ul>
Across recent Windows 11 updates, we have optimized:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>More security with better performance for Enhanced Secure Sign-On (ESS)</strong>. ESS provides increased security by building memory enclaves that can be hidden from the rest of the system.  We improved performance by up to 10% in cases where the system is under memory pressure by more efficiently handling the secure enclaves’ large slabs of memory.  This also enables us to ship on a larger range of RAM sizes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consistent Windows Hello performance with app orchestration</strong>. When you resume your machine and kick off Windows Hello, apps also start resuming in the background and can consume system resources, slowing down your Hello performance.  We delay the resume of these apps until after Windows Hello camera startup and face authentication is complete.</li>
</ul>
These features are now available to customers and will enable faster Instant On experience with fewer Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) on the lock screen that can save up to 8% in cases where many apps are resuming.
<h3>What Is New?</h3>
We continue to invest in ensuring core Windows scenarios have great fundamentals.  Over the course of the last year, we also asked each feature team-building experiences in Windows to take a close look at their features to find additional opportunities to optimize the OS experiences.  We were surprised and energized by the breadth of optimizations made across the entire product, and we are excited to bring these improvements to all our customers.

We started this effort by conducting trainings across the entire organization on best practices, techniques, and educating the organization on the latest tools and techniques for performance analysis.  The energy and momentum that this created was invigorating as every team was empowered to improve any part of the operating system they chose.  This effort resulted in over 300 different performance improvements across Windows!  Here is a subset of some of the improvements available for you on all your Windows 11 devices.

<strong>Faster, more responsive post-boot experience</strong>

Today, when you boot a PC, there are a number of things that happen behind the scenes.  If you have a lot of apps registered to start at boot, it can be a stampede of apps all clamoring for resources to launch.  While investigating a boot perf issue, we experimented with moderating app startups.

What we found was we can both ensure the apps the user is trying to interact with are responsive and prioritized, and also that in many cases the background apps finish launching faster due to reduced contention.  Rather than unleash all the start up apps at once, we moderate their launches.  This helps avoid significant contention at launch and ensures the foreground app the user is interacting with stays performant and responsive.

These improvements most benefit devices with fewer resources, and we measured a 25-50% improvement in application launch times in the time period after logon in our experiment with multiple startup apps.  The image below helps visualize this, where we moderate startup apps to ensure that user-initiated operations can run with less contention.  In this example, you can see the user’s app completes its launch faster, and the background startup apps also complete in a similar timeframe due to less contention for resources.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56781 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-4-Moderated-app-start-up.png" alt="" width="874" height="318" />

<strong>File Explorer improvements</strong>

We made several improvements in File Explorer, including improving launch time of File explorer for users who have files stored in the cloud by avoiding I/O to enumerate cloud files.  We also looked at deleting files and made improvements to bulk file delete operations by over 40% as shown in our results below!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56777 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-5-File-Explorer-delete.png" alt="" width="414" height="366" />

While it may be rare for users to delete large numbers of files on their device all at once, the example shows the breadth of the improvements we set out to bring to Windows 11 users.

<strong>Reduced game stutter with high report rate mice</strong>

We know gamers hate stutter, and we’re fixing issues throughout Windows so that an untimely frame-freeze won’t take gamers out of their immersive experiences.  Gamers love to push their systems to the limit in search of the best experiences in-game.  Many also use sensitive, high DPI, high report rate mice to shave milliseconds off their response times and increase precision.  At the same time, the world of gaming is more connected than ever with gamers relying on an increasing number of background apps while playing, like voice chat, streaming, apps for configuring your keyboard, mouse, or graphics card, and more.  The Windows input stack was being pushed to its limits with high report rate mice and their input being delivered to not just the game, but also multiple background processes.  In turn, that caused a significant amount of time processing input rather than providing as many cycles as possible for rendering the game experience.

We set out to reduce the amount of processing time it took to handle input requests by throttling and coalescing background raw mouse listeners and capping their message rate.  Prior to these changes, we observed on a Surface Laptop Studio with a 1000 Hz mouse, a test bed of background listeners, and popular games that there was significant stutter.  After the improvements, on the same setup, we now deliver a smooth, uninterrupted gaming experience and preserve the low latency, high precision input experience in games while being efficient with input for background listeners!

<strong>Something for everyone</strong>

While the examples above highlight some of the improvements in the February and May updates, there are many other improvements available today, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Taskbar improvements to ensure Taskbar is readily available after logging in</li>
 	<li>Task View performance improvements when devices are under heavy load</li>
 	<li>Improved performance of Windows Notification Service</li>
 	<li>Improved launch time of Quick Settings and Notification Center</li>
 	<li>Reduced threads, dlls, and graphics device count in Explorer</li>
 	<li>Reduced CPU usage of explorer</li>
 	<li>Reduced memory usage of Notification Center</li>
 	<li>Touch keyboard performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Resource usage reductions in multi-user scenarios</li>
 	<li>Reduced voice access and Narrator latency in larger documents</li>
 	<li>Improved voice typing activation time</li>
 	<li>Improved speed of theme changes</li>
 	<li>Reduced size on disk by leveraging features-on-demand via the Store</li>
</ul>
For developers, there is a lot coming in the May release too.  Some highlights that intersect fundamentals:
<ul>
 	<li>New enhanced kernel minidump format for better debugging</li>
 	<li>Live kernel dumps can now be collected directly via Task Manager</li>
 	<li>New richer, more actionable third-party reliability data views in Partner Center</li>
 	<li>Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) is now supported and available on Arm devices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applications That Run on Windows Have Improved</h3>
There are great recent wins across key apps on Windows as well that we should celebrate.  We partner closely with these teams, share approaches to performance and fundamentals, and collaborate on improvements.

<strong>Microsoft Edge performance improvements</strong>

Browsing the web is one of the most common activities users perform.  Edge continually invests in not just improving the browsing experience for users, but in improving performance and minimizing resource usage.  Sleeping Tabs was introduced in Edge over a year ago, and the team has continued to improve the effectiveness of it to reduce memory and power usage of tabs.  Most users have up to 7 tabs open at any point in time, and while only 1 tab is often visible, those other tabs can have significant impacts on both memory and power.

With Sleeping Tabs, when you switch away from a tab we can reduce the memory and CPU usage of the background tabs, and just as importantly, we are able to resume faster than if we fully discarded the background tab.  Our diagnostic data shows that at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, a tab can consume as much as 400MB of private working set.  With up to 6 tabs in the background, this adds up to nearly 2.4GB of memory being consumed.  With Sleeping Tabs, we can reduce the private working set of a tab down to 75MB!  A savings of nearly 2GB of memory (83% reduction), providing memory to other applications and services.  In addition, we have seen an over 15% improvement in the startup time of the Edge browser!

When you are mobile, getting the most out of your battery is important so you can keep working until you can plug in again.  Efficiency mode in Microsoft Edge helps you get the most out of every charge.  Through efficient reduction of CPU usage, Microsoft Edge can extend battery life on average of 25 minutes when efficiency mode is active.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56782 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-8-Edge-Sleeping-Tabs-1024x513.png" alt="" width="1024" height="513" />

<strong>The New Microsoft Teams App for Windows</strong>

Microsoft Teams has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and the team intently focused on scale and rapid growth.  Together, we spent quite a bit of time understanding the common use cases and scenarios.  A big focus for the team was moving to a new architecture and backend services that drove a 2x performance improvement, while consuming half the resources.  Bold fundamentals goals were set that required the team to step back and rearchitect significant parts of the software that enables all of us to connect and collaborate across the globe!  For more details on the improvements made with the new Teams client refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/27/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-microsoft-teams/">Teams blog</a>.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Microsoft 2023 Build conference, </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56688"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panos Panay announced ONNX Runtime as the gateway to Windows AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using ONNX Runtime gives third party developers the same tools we use internally to run AI models on any Windows or other devices across CPU, GPU, NPU, or hybrid with Azure. We are also introducing Olive, a toolchain we created to ease the burden on developers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimize models for varied Windows and other devices.  Both ONNX Runtime and Olive contribute to the velocity of getting your AI models deployed into apps.</span>

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-56737 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/ONNX-Runtime-Build-2023-final-1024x539.png" alt="" width="1024" height="539" /></strong>
<h3><b>What is ONNX Runtime?</b></h3>
<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cross-platform, cross-IHV inferencing engine that allows developers to inference across platforms (e.g. iOS, Windows, Android, Linux), across client and cloud devices (CPU/GPU/NPU) or hybrid inferencing between client and Cloud (Azure EP).  EPs are Execution Providers which allow targeting of specific hardware devices on specific IHV hardware (i.e. Qualcomm QNN EP for the Windows on Arm Surface Pro 9 5G) or using DML EP on Windows devices to abstract away which IHV or device is being used.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime makes it easier for you to create amazing AI experiences on Windows and other platforms with less engineering effort and better performance. Olive simplifies the optimization process and eliminates the need for deep hardware knowledge.  ONNX Runtime is the future of AI development on Windows.</span>
<h3><b>What is Olive?</b></h3>
<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/olive.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an extensible hardware-aware model optimization tool that composes cutting-edge techniques across model compression, optimization, and compilation. Olive takes a PyTorch or ONNX model and a configuration file and runs optimization tools to create the most optimal model for a specified hardware device. Olive then produces a package that contains the optimized models, ONNX Runtime, the right ONNX Runtime EP, configuration files, and sample code for that EP. This package can be easily integrated into your app.  </span>
<h3><b>Hybrid inferencing and lighting up NPUs with new EPs in ONNX Runtime </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ONNX Runtime now supports the same API for running models on the device or in the cloud, enabling hybrid inferencing scenarios where your app can use local resources when possible and switch to the cloud when needed. With the new Azure EP preview, you can connect to models deployed in AzureML or even to the Azure OpenAI service, starting with the Whisper model. You just need a few lines of code to specify the cloud endpoint and add your own criteria for when to use the cloud. This gives you more control over costs and user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure EP gives you the flexibility to choose between using the larger model in the cloud or the local model at runtime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are the latest silicon that were built from the ground up to support AI workloads and are incredibly energy efficient while offloading workloads from the CPU.   We also support inferencing in browsers with ORT Web and are working with partners on incorporating WebNN.</span>

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-56739 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/MSFT-AI-Blog-Image-2-1024x542.png" alt="" width="1024" height="542" /></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you are excited about these new capabilities in ONNX Runtime and Olive. We encourage you to try them out and share your feedback with us. We are always looking for ways to improve our tools and support more scenarios for our users.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn more about ONNX Runtime and Olive and how they can help you build amazing Windows AI applications with ONNX Runtime, visit </span><a href="https://onnxruntime.ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://onnxruntime.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information and documentation.</span>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The team and I are pumped to be back at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/">Build</a> with the developer community this year.

Over the last year, Windows has continued to see incredible growth fueled by Windows 11 adoption. In fact, one of the most exciting areas driving that growth for Windows has been developers themselves, with a 24% YoY increase in monthly devices used for development.

AI is the defining technology of our time and developers are at the forefront of this transformation. With the right tools we can empower developers and our shared customers to shape the future and leave their mark on the world. We are just starting to see the incredible impact AI is having across industries and in our own daily lives. Today, the team and I are excited to share the next steps we are taking on our journey with Windows 11, to meet this new age of AI.
<ul>
 	<li>We are <strong>introducing Windows Copilot</strong>, making Windows 11 the first PC platform to announce centralized AI assistance to help people easily take action and get things done.</li>
 	<li>We are extending <strong>Bing Chat plugins to Windows, </strong>enabling developers to integrate their apps within Windows Copilot to better serve their customers and increase engagement on native Windows applications.</li>
 	<li>We are introducing new <strong>Hybrid AI loop</strong> to support AI development <strong>across platform, and </strong><strong>across Azure to client with new </strong><strong>silicon support</strong> from AMD, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm.</li>
 	<li><strong>We are introducing Dev Home</strong> designed to help every developer become more productive on Windows.</li>
 	<li><strong>We are introducing new AI features</strong> and experiences in the Microsoft Store on Windows.</li>
</ul>
We can’t wait to share more with you tomorrow during our Windows keynote, <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/sessions/8aab36d1-d27d-46dd-81ec-eb3f49cfee6a?source=sessions">be sure to register for Build and tune in</a>!
<h4><strong>Introducing Windows Copilot for Windows 11</strong></h4>
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfwc-NNo30[/embed]

We’re thrilled to introduce Windows Copilot. Windows is the first PC platform to provide centralized AI assistance for customers. Together, with Bing Chat and first- and third-party plugins, you can focus on bringing your ideas to life, completing complex projects and collaborating instead of spending energy finding, launching and working across multiple applications.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56742 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Windows-Dev-Blog_Windows-Copilot-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" />

Invoking Windows Copilot is familiar and easy – the button is front and center on your taskbar – simple to find and use. Once open, the Windows Copilot side bar stays consistent across your apps, programs and windows, always available to act as your personal assistant. It makes every user a power user, helping you take action, customize your settings and seamlessly connect across your favorite apps. The things you love about Windows – copy/paste, Snap Assist, Snipping Tool, personalization – they are all right there for you, along with every other feature on the platform, and they only get better with Windows Copilot. For example, you can not only copy and paste, but also ask Windows Copilot to rewrite, summarize or explain your content.

Just like you would with Bing Chat, you can ask Windows Copilot a range of questions from simple to complex. If I want to call my family in Cyprus, I can quickly check the local time to make sure I’m not waking them up in the middle of the night. If I want to plan a trip to visit them in Cyprus, I can ask Windows Copilot to find my family flights and accommodations for mid-winter break.

With Bing and ChatGPT plugins in Windows Copilot, people will not only have access to augmented AI capabilities and experiences, but you as developers will also have new ways to reach and innovate for our shared customers. We welcome you to be part of the Windows Copilot journey by continuing to invest in Bing and ChatGPT plugins so your investments will carry forward to Windows Copilot.

Windows Copilot will start to become available in preview for Windows 11 in June, stay tuned <a href="https://aka.ms/PluginsForWindows">and <u>sign up here</u></a> to get updates from the team.
<h4><strong>Empowering every Windows 11 developer to be an AI developer  </strong></h4>
This is an incredible time to be a developer on Windows. The possibilities across industries - healthcare, finance, education, tech, and others - are endless. We continue to invest in important tools to democratize how apps will be built for the new era of AI; whether you’re developing on x86/x64 or Arm64 we want to make it easy for you to bring AI powered experiences in Windows apps across cloud and edge.

If you are just getting started with AI or if you are wondering where to start, Microsoft and Windows are here to help you on that journey. Today, we are announcing the Windows AI Library, which will house a curated collection of ready to use machine learning models and APIs that will help jumpstart your AI development.  We will share more details on the availability and preview dates in the coming weeks.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56743 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/ONNX-Runtime-Build-2023-final-1-1024x539.png" alt="" width="1024" height="539" />

<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/create-next-generation-experiences-at-scale-with-windows/">Last year at Build</a>, we announced Hybrid Loop, a new development pattern that enables hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. Today, we are excited to share that our vision has become a reality using ONNX Runtime as the gateway to Windows AI and Olive, a toolchain we created to ease the burden on you when optimizing models for varied Windows and other devices. With ONNX Runtime, third-party developers have access to the same tools we use internally to run AI models on Windows or other devices across CPU, GPU, NPU, or hybrid with Azure.

ONNX Runtime now supports the same API for running models on the device or in the cloud, enabling hybrid inferencing scenarios where your app can use local resources when possible and switch to the cloud when needed. With the new Azure EP preview, you can connect to models deployed in AzureML or even to the Azure OpenAI service. With just a few lines of code you can specify the cloud endpoint and define your criteria for when to use the cloud. This gives you more control over costs and user experience, as Azure EP gives you the flexibility to choose between using the larger model in the cloud or the smaller local model at runtime.

You can also optimize your models for different hardware targets with Olive, an extensible toolchain that combines cutting edge techniques for model compression, optimization and compilation. And you can use ONNX Runtime across platforms like Windows, iOS, Android and Linux, so your Windows AI investment can extend to all your app platforms.

Both <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56722">ONNX Runtime and Olive</a> contribute to the velocity of getting your AI models deployed into apps. ONNX Runtime makes it easier for you to create amazing AI experiences on Windows and other platforms, with less engineering effort and better performance.

<strong>Extending our vision for an AI powered future in collaboration with our partners</strong>

Windows 11 has the largest and most powerful ecosystem of GPUs in the world with more than 200M+ AI capable discrete GPUs. Windows PCs like Surface Studio 2+, and PCs built by partners such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung are powered by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/23/microsoft-build-nvidia-ai-windows-rtx">NVIDIA</a> GPUs. Developers can leverage these GPUs today to run cutting-edge transformer models like Dolly 2.0, Stable Diffusion and NVIDIA’s NeMo that are pre-optimized for Windows.

NPUs (Neural Processing Units) are purpose-built accelerators to run AI models efficiently. Our partners are continuing to innovate and deliver – like <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/05/qualcomm-and-microsoft-align-efforts-to-scale-on-device-ai-at-bu">Qualcomm</a> with the Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 Compute Platform which today enables Windows devices including the Surface Pro 9 5G and the Windows Dev Kit 2023. With Olive &amp; ONNX Runtime you can target Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK to run AI models on the 8cx Gen 3 compute platform NPU.

We are excited to see all our silicon partners bring more Windows devices with NPUs to the market later this year.  <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/corporate/amd-accelerates-ai-adoption-on-windows-11-with-new-developer/ba-p/607847">AMD</a> recently made early access of Ryzen™ AI software available to developers to run AI models on AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors with Ryzen™ AI. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/ai-coming-to-pc-at-scale.html#gs.yj4jwh">Intel previewed</a> their new Meteor Lake product, an all-new chiplet SoC architecture that will feature Intel's first integrated AI engine which will scale across the Windows ecosystem starting later this year and will also make available developer tools, including ONNX Runtime support enabled through OpenVino-EP and DirectML-EP.

Partners such as WhatsApp, Luminar Neo and Camo are achieving incredible leaps in performance and unlocking new end-user experiences by leveraging NPUs to run their AI models.  Bring your apps to the Windows platform and leverage ONNX Runtime to deliver AI experiences like Camo.  We can’t wait to see what the Windows developer community will create with these new AI toolchains and NPU hardware advancements.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We wouldn’t be where we are today without the developer community. Together, we’ve been on a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">journey</a> to reimagine an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">open app store</a> and provide a better experience for Windows customers. It’s because of this partnership that the Microsoft Store on Windows is now used by over one billion customers with more than 50% of new Windows 11 customers engaging with the Microsoft Store in the first 30 days.

The momentum of Windows customers is a testament to the growth in quality content from our passionate community of developers, who have more than doubled the number of Win32 and PWA apps since last year. Engaging PWAs like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/snapchat/9PF9RTKMMQ69">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/espn/9NWD3S85MTFB">ESPN</a>, sophisticated native apps like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/spark-mail-%E2%80%93-email-app-by-readdle/XPFCS9QJBKTHVZ">Spark Mail</a>, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/capture-one/XPDC1MTSBZZ97K">Capture One</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9/XPDDVC6XTQQKMM">Bilibili</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NKSQGP7F2NH">WhatsApp</a>, along with Android apps like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/epic-seven/XP9MK6MFVQBW1X">Epic Seven</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/best-fiends/XPDCF98W6GPBCD">Best Fiends</a>, and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/blink/XP99WSCF81Z8JB">Blink</a>, are truly what makes the Microsoft Store the best place to find the right content, whether for productivity, entertainment or creativity. There are many more apps to recognize, including the winners of the Microsoft Store Awards 2023 which can be found <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56717">here</a>.

<strong>Today, we are proud to share the next phase of our journey for the Microsoft Store on Windows and announce new experiences, features and tools.</strong> We are focused on building an open store that is ready for the new AI era, and to provide developers with new tools like Microsoft Store Ads to reach even more customers.
<h4><strong>Microsoft Store opens the doors to AI </strong></h4>
The world around us is changing every day. As AI disrupts existing workflows and creates exciting new opportunities for customers, we see an opportunity to evolve and think differently about the role of the Microsoft Store on Windows. It’s not just a place to download an app or a game, but rather, it should serve as a resource to educate customers about how they can be more productive, achieve their tasks, and discover new content.

<strong>Introducing</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>AI Hub,</strong> a new curated section in the Microsoft Store where we will promote the best AI experiences built by the developer community and Microsoft. This is a space where we will educate customers on how to start and expand their AI journey, inspiring them to use AI in everyday ways to boost productivity, spark creativity and so much more. For example, you will be able to use AI to express your creativity through <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/luminar-neo-photo-editor/9P7JQGL6GC8P">Luminar Neo</a> and Lensa, master your video and audio with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/descript/XP8BSML4BXT27N">Descript</a>, Krisp and Podcastle, present your ideas with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gamma/9MV4LSCDRFLT">Gamma</a> and Copy.ai, build your resume with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/kickresume/9NBLGGH4RN56">Kickresume</a>, generate your voice with <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/playht/9MSVX1XLWJGM">Play.ht</a>, or even plan your trip with Tripnotes. All the content will be tested for security, family safety, and device compatibility – so you are always in control. This feature will soon be available in the Microsoft Store. If you are an AI developer and interested in being featured in the AI Hub, let us know <a href="https://aka.ms/MicrosoftStoreAIHub">here</a>.

<strong>Customers can take advantage of AI-Generated review summary. </strong>This new feature summarizes customer reviews and provides a concise summary highlighting the topline details. We know customers use the Microsoft Store to view and gather community feedback when considering and choosing new apps and games. However, especially with popular apps that have thousands of reviews, sifting through each one can take time. Supported by AI, this feature is designed to make the customer experience even more seamless. AI-Generated review summaries will soon be available in the Microsoft Store.

<h4><strong>Reach more customers with new developer tools and expanded services</strong></h4>
Earlier this year, we announced the availability of Microsoft Store Ads in search results and shared plans to expand the experience to premium ad placements in search. In just two months, we have seen more developers adopt this new channel and receive positive results. Miracle Games experienced a 25% increase in app installs compared to before at a CPI that is 90% lower than on other advertising channels. <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/stories/miracle-games-increased-app-downloads?s_cid=en-us-acq-onemsft-src_msstore-sub_msstoreemail-flx_storeadsgtm">Learn more about Miracle Games story here</a>.

Today, we are excited to release new services that will help developers connect to more customers and address some of the most popular developer feedback:

<strong>Microsoft Store Ads is expanding in more ways than one</strong>

Starting next month, Microsoft Store Ads will be <strong>discoverable in Bing.com search results</strong>, along with Microsoft Store search results. To take advantage of these capabilities, create a Store Ads Campaign in Microsoft Advertising. We are also making available a new Attribution SDK for MSIX apps and coming soon for Win32 and PWAs. Learn more <a href="https://aka.ms/MicrosoftStoreAds">here</a>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56764 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/bing-search-results-contoso-1024x534.png" alt="" width="1024" height="534" />

Developers now have the option to <strong>display rich advertising in the spotlight section</strong> in the Microsoft Store. This provides a new large and high-traffic surface for advertisers and supports video ad formats. If you are interested in participating in the pilot program, please submit a request <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0qhf-gSatdCgmqCvPskx_NUMkdSMjJXSDlTN1BDMjBTOE5XN1FLWExTRC4u&fswReload=1&fswNavStart=1683832285647">here</a>.

Starting in June, <strong>Microsoft Store Ads will expand beyond the U.S. market</strong>, supported by Microsoft Advertising, to more than 150 regions worldwide. Advertisers with a presence in other countries will soon be able to leverage this channel to achieve their acquisition goals.

<strong>Keeping customers engaged across devices has just gotten easier </strong>

Retention is another key challenge for developers. Last year, we announced a feature that allows customers to easily transition apps from one device to another.

Today, we are <strong>introducing a new backup and restore capability on Windows </strong>that helps keep customers engaged across devices. When customers transition from a Windows 10 or 11 device to their new Windows 11 device, the icons for Store apps will automatically get restored right where they had them – on the Start menu and Taskbar.
