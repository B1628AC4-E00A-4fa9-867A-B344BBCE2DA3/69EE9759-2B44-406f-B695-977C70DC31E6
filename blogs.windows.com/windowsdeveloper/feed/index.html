										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our mission is to create one of the most powerful, simple, and aesthetically pleasing web rendering engines in the world. Fueled by our passion to make it completely open and free for everyone.

Today is an important milestone for the Babylon.js platform and we are thrilled to announce the launch of the next version of the Babylon.js platform, Babylon.js 5.0.

[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zELYw2qEUjI[/embed]

Babylon.js 5.0 is quite simply the biggest, boldest, and most ambitious update to the platform to date. From full support of WebGPU, to the ability to deploy experiences across platforms with Native Capabilities, to more tools, features, and improvements than you can count — Babylon.js 5.0 ushers in the next generation of web rendering technology for everyone.

Before diving into more detail, we want to take a quick moment to humbly thank the incredible community of developers, the 400+ contributors, and the steadfast advocates that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing platform. Babylon.js would not be here without you.
<h3><strong>WebGPU</strong></h3>
WebGPU represents the next evolution in browser to GPU communication. The W3C's "GPU for the Web" Community Group built it from the ground up with performance in mind. WebGPU offers web developers access to some of the most advanced modern graphics capabilities such as compute shaders and lightning-fast texture loading. We have been actively participating in the WebGPU working group from its earliest days and are proud to announce that Babylon.js 5.0 offers FULL support for WebGPU.

This means that with Babylon.js 5.0 you can develop mind-bending, rendering experiences on the web using both WebGL and WebGPU - you don’t have to learn a new graphics API, Babylon.js takes care of it for you!

As WebGPU becomes more broadly available in your favorite browsers later this year, and Babylon.js 5.0 is set up and ready for you to take advantage of this new performance rocket ship!

WebGPU Demos (Must use a WebGPU compatible browser):

<h3><strong>Cross-platform Native Deployment</strong></h3>
We know developers want to reach as many people as possible with as little effort as possible. We are proud to announce that Babylon.js 5.0 unlocks the ability to use the Babylon.js API to develop web AND native applications. Whether you’re targeting Web, Windows, Mac, iPhone, or Android Phone, Babylon.js 5.0 allows you to write your rendering code once and deploy it across the platforms of your choice, using the browser OR as native applications!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 16th the Windows App SDK team released version 1.0! It’s the starting point for your ability to build and ship Windows desktop apps with Windows 10 and Windows 11. It includes the ability to use Windows App SDK with a .NET 5+ app, as well as WinUI 3 and WebView2 for modern UI development. Windows App SDK 1.0 is one of many important improvements you can use to create great Windows apps and we can't wait to keep moving forward with even more features!
<h3><strong>What is the Windows App SDK?</strong></h3>
When building an app with Windows App SDK you have access to both modern Windows technologies and new features, while also having access to the power of Desktop Win32. These technologies are decoupled from the OS and ship through <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK/">NuGet</a> so they can be adopted incrementally across all 1 billion + Windows devices, without having to wait for users to update their OS. With WinAppSDK you are in control of upgrading to new Versions!

When building an app with Windows App SDK, you’ll start by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022">installing the developer tools</a>. This provides WinUI 3 project and item templates and sets up your app to reference the Windows App SDK package and any needed dependencies. Then you can create an app with a modern Windows 11 experience using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">WinUI 3</a>.
<h3><strong>What’s supported in Windows App SDK 1.0?</strong></h3>
Lots of features are available both new and continuing from previous versions!
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md#winui-3">WinUI 3</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/dwritecore">Text Rendering (DWrite Core)</a></li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-instanced apps only allow one instance of the app running at a time. WinUI apps are multi-instanced by default. They allow you to launch multiple instances of the same app at one time, which we call multiple instances. However, you may implement single-instancing based on the use case of your app. Attempting to launch a second instance of a single-instanced app will only result in the first instance’s main window being activated instead. This tutorial demonstrates how to implement single-instancing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this section, you will be able to: 1. Turn off XAML’s generated Program code 2. Define customized MAIN method for redirection 3. Test single-instancing via app deployment</span>
<h3><b>Turn off XAML’s generated Program code</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to check for redirection as early as possible, and before creating any windows. To do this, we must define the symbol “DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN” in the project build properties.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Double-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name in Solution Explorer:</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Define the <b>DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN</b> symbol below</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DrumPad:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x86'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x86'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|arm64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;
&lt;propertygroup condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|arm64'"&gt;
  &lt;defineconstants&gt;DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN&lt;/defineconstants&gt;
&lt;/propertygroup&gt;</pre>
<h3><b>Define a customized Program class with a Main method</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A customized Program.cs file is created instead of running the default Main method because it enables the app to check for redirection, which is not what WinUI apps default to doing.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to Solution Explorer -&gt; </span><b>Right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name -&gt; Add -&gt; New Item</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><b>Visual C# Items</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -&gt; Code -&gt; Class -&gt; Name it </span><b>Program.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -&gt; Add</span></li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your project should look like this:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56432" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture1.png-BLOG-3.png" alt="" width="832" height="828" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Add the following namespaces:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using System.Threading;
using Microsoft.UI.Dispatching;
using Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle;
using Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation;
using Windows.Storage;</pre>
4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace the empty class Program with following:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">class program
{
    [STAThread]
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        WinRT.ComWrappersSupport.InitializeComWrappers();
        bool isRedirect = await DecideRedirection();
        if (!isRedirect)
        {
            Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application.Start((p) =&gt;
            {
                var context = new DispatcherQueueSynchronizationContext(
                    DispatcherQueue.GetForCurrentThread());
                SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(context);
                new App();
            });
        }

        return 0;
    }</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Main determines if it should redirect or launch a new app instance via DecideRedirection();</span>

5. D<span style="font-weight: 400;">efine DecideRedirection() below the Main method:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private static async Task DecideRedirection()
{
    bool isRedirect = false;
    AppActivationArguments args = AppInstance.GetCurrent().GetActivatedEventArgs();
    ExtendedActivationKind kind = args.Kind;
    AppInstance keyInstance = AppInstance.FindOrRegisterForKey("randomKey");
    
    if (keyInstance.IsCurrent) {
        keyInstance.Activated += OnActivated;
    }
    else {
        isRedirect = true;
        await keyInstance.RedirectActivationToAsync(args);
    }
    return isRedirect;
}
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: DecideRedirection determines if the app has been registered by registering a key that represents your app instance. Based on the result of key registration, it infers if there is a current app instancing running; therefore, whether or not to redirect or allow the app to launch for the first time</span>

6. D<span style="font-weight: 400;">efine the helper method OnActivated(), below the DecideRedirection method:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Program.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private static void OnActivated(object sender, AppActivationArguments args)
{
    ExtendedActivationKind kind = args.Kind;
}</pre>
<h3><b>Testing single-instancing via app deployment</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, we have been testing our app by running the solution debugger. We can only have one debugger running at once. Therefore, it prevents us from knowing whether the app is single-instanced because we can’t debug the same project solution twice at the same time. To test, we will deploy the application. After deploying, we can launch the app from the desktop like how you would with Microsoft Word.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to Solution Explorer -&gt; </span><b>Right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the project name -&gt; </span><b>Deploy</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the start menu and click on the search field</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type “DrumPad” (or your app’s name) in the search field</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on the app icon from the search result to launch the app</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat steps 2 to 4 to launch the same app again and see if another instance pops up</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Result</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56433" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture2.gif-BLOG-3.gif" alt="" width="1388" height="1080" />
<h3><b>Wrapping up</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56420&amp;preview=true"><b>In part 1</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we learned how to use WinUI 3 controls to create the app’s visual layer.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><b>Adding event handlers: Sounds, Dark Mode &amp; Windowing (Part 2)</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56420&amp;preview=true">part 1</a> of the WinAppSDK Blog Series you implemented the visual layer of the DrumPad using WinUI 3 controls. However, if you click on any buttons, nothing happens, because we have not defined any actions, which we will do now. You will be guided to accomplish the following in this post: </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play a sound when a drum pad button is clicked </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch into dark mode when the toggle switch is turned on </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go into a specific windowing mode when a presenter mode is selected</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Play a sound when a drum pad button is clicked</b></h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download sound clips to your project’s Assets folder</span></li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You may download any .wav sound clips for this part. Optionally, you could use my sound clips </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/tree/5c6e560edf74ceb0a40183e20b66741175a046d7/DrumPad/DrumPad/Assets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. Store the sound clips under your project’s Assets folder because that is the folder path we will provide to specify which sound to play.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Install the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">System.Windows.Extensions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NuGet Package</span>

<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Playing a sound in WinUI apps requires using a library called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">System.Media</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, accessible through a NuGet Package. Following these two steps to install the NuGet Package in Visual Studio:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to </span><b>Solution Explorer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, under Dependencies, </span><b>right-click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Packages, select Manage NuGet Packages</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the </span><b>Browse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab, search </span><b>System.Windows.Extensions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>install</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Add the following namespace to </span><b>MainAppWindow.xaml.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using System.Media;
</pre>
4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a call-back function that plays a sound in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainAppWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void pad_clicked(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // get the full path to your app’s folder where it is installed
    var installedPath = Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.Path;
    // join path above with the sub-paths in your Assets folder and the specific sound file
    var soundFile = Path.Join(installedPath, "Assets", "rim.wav");

    SoundPlayer player = new System.Media.SoundPlayer(soundFile);
    player.Play();
}</pre>
5. l<span style="font-weight: 400;">ink the call-back function above to a button via the </span><b>Click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" … … Click="pad_clicked" /&gt;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat step 4 and 5 to attach another sound clip to a different button until all the buttons have a click action! For your reference, check out my </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/blob/App_Logic/DrumPad/DrumPad/MainWindow.xaml.cs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/WinAppSDK-DrumPad/blob/App_Logic/DrumPad/DrumPad/MainWindow.xaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on GitHub.</span>
<h3><b>Implement dark mode</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark mode is an app appearance where the content is laid out on a dark background. It gives the app a different aesthetic look and can improve readability, especially in a low-light environment.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define SolidColorBrush under the light and dark themes below the comment &lt;!– Other app resources here –&gt;:</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">App.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Key="Light"&gt;
        &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="HomePageBackgroundBrush" Color="Transparent"/&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Key="Dark"&gt;
        &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="HomePageBackgroundBrush" Color="Black"/&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
&lt;/ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Indicate which theme to use via the </span><b>Background</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter (here we specified it on the outermost Grid in MainWindow.xaml):</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Grid Background="{ThemeResource HomePageBackgroundBrush}"&gt;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Define the action for ToggleSwitch in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWinow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void ToggleSwitch_Toggled(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ToggleSwitch toggleSwitch = sender as ToggleSwitch;
    if (toggleSwitch.IsOn) {
        ((FrameworkElement)this.Content).RequestedTheme = ElementTheme.Dark;
    }
    else {
        ((FrameworkElement)this.Content).RequestedTheme = ElementTheme.Light;
    }
}</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    4. Link the call-back function above to the ToggleSwitch control:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;ToggleSwitch … … Toggled="ToggleSwitch_Toggled" /&gt;
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You can save the state of the theme resource and persist the option the user chose at the next time of app startup with four easy steps. Follow </span><a href="https://github.com/jingwei-a-zhang/test-MDfiles/blob/main/DarkModeExtra.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement this functionality.</span>
<h3><b>Managing window display</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Windowing features in WinAppSDK provides a lot of flexibility and customization to your app experience. One of these customization features is the ability to change the Presenter mode of your window. There are 3 presenters you can use: Compact Overlay, Fullscreen, and Overlapped mode, with overlapped being the default presenter.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the following namespaces:</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">using WinRT;
// Needed for WindowId
using Microsoft.UI;
// Needed for AppWindow
using Microsoft.UI.Windowing;
// Needed for XAML hwnd interop
using WinRT.Interop;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    2. Declare the following variable in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">AppWindow m_appWindow;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    3. Define a helper method </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow()</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private AppWindow GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow()
{
    IntPtr hWnd = WinRT.Interop.WindowNative.GetWindowHandle(this);
    WindowId myWndId = Microsoft.UI.Win32Interop.GetWindowIdFromWindow(hWnd);
    return AppWindow.GetFromWindowId(myWndId);
}</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The preceding code gets the window Id for the hwnd and then uses that window Id to get the current AppWindow. This will create the WinAppSDK window layer that gives you access to all the window customization features of the app window.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    4. Call GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow in the </span><b>MainWindow() method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">m_appWindow = GetAppWindowForCurrentWindow();
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    5. Set the current app window to the Compact Overlay presenter via the SetPresenter method in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">class MainWindow : Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">private void SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    m_appWindow.SetPresenter(AppWindowPresenterKind.CompactOverlay);
}</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    6. Modify the MenuFlyouItem control to add the SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay function using the </span><b>Click</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parameter:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;MenuFlyoutItem Text="Compact Overlay" Click="SwtichPresenter_CompOverlay"/&gt;
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Repeat the steps 5 and 6 to implement the FullScreen and Overlapped (the default) presenters. The only change needed is to modify step 5 to use AppWindowPresenterKind.Overlapped or AppWindowPresenterKind.FullScreen.</span>
<h3><b>Result</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56427" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture1.gif-BLOG-2.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="938" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, you can see how we can leverage the amazing Windowing features to customize windowing options for your app. If you run your app again and click the drop-down button and choose Compact Overlay, the app window will not allow other app windows to overlap on top of it. To learn more about Windowing, see </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/windowing/windowing-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage app windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for additional information on what you can do with this feature.</span>

<h3><b>Moving forward</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we will keep evolving the app with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/01/28/making-the-app-single-instanced-part-3/">s</a><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/01/28/making-the-app-single-instanced-part-3/">ingle-instancing</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows App SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WinUI 3 provides a modernized UI framework for building Windows 10 and Windows 11. This 3-part blog aims to help members new to Windows development quickly build familiarity using the Window App SDK through a fun sample app.</span>

<b>This post is only part 1 of the 3-part Windows App SDK blog</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is scoped to showing you how to use WinUI 3 controls to create a simple working user interface. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56426&amp;preview=true">2</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/01/28/making-the-app-single-instanced-part-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are for windowing and single instancing.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56417" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture2.png-BLOG-1.png" alt="" width="1872" height="1192" /></h3>
<h3><b>Sample app overview</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are going to build an app with buttons that produce drum sounds (DrumPad). As simple as this demo app is, it shows some cool things you can do right away with the Windows App SDK (WinAppSDK): </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Working with simple and easy-to-use UI controls from </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3</span></a></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizing </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/windowing/windowing-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windowing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options so that the user can multitask with the app always on top or have a full immersive experience </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the app </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/applifecycle/applifecycle-instancing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-instanced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce synchronization issues between instances</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Prerequisites</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install tools for developing apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11 </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">Create a WinUI 3 app</a> using the Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop) template, and name it <b>DrumPad</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Project template structure</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the WinUI 3 project template, most of our code will live in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs</span></i>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MainWindow.xaml</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a XAML file where we will define all of our UI elements, called “controls”, that will make up the visual layer of our application.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MainWindow.xaml.cs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the C# code-behind file where we will put all the logic that lets us interact with our application.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>UI layout design</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following WinUI 3 controls are used to represent components of a drum pad: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.dropdownbutton?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DropDownButton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: includes a chevron to indicate a menu can be opened </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.toggleswitch?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ToggleSwitch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a switch that can be toggled between dark/light mode </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.button?view=winui-3.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: has a click user interaction and will trigger a unique drum sound </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.grid?view=winui-3.0">Grid</a>: made of rows and columns and is used to position the other controls</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56416" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/01/Picture1.png-blog-1.png" alt="" width="1872" height="1300" />
<h3><b>Deleting partial template code</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The default project template comes with some blocks of code you’ll want to delete so we can replace them with our own markup and implementation:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml:</span><!-- Delete the following template code -->
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;!-- Delete the following template code --&gt;

&lt;StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center"&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="myButton" Click="myButton_Click"&gt;Click Me&lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;</pre>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">MainWindow.xaml.cs:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">// Delete the following template code

private void myButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    myButton.Content = "Clicked";
}
</pre>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Defining the layout</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your MainWindow.xaml we will start by defining the set of nested grids and specify their controls and positioning. Open MainWindow.xaml in the XML editor view and inside the </span><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> element add this content:</span><!-- Add GRID CODE --> <!-- STEP 1: Add DropDownButton & ToggleSwitch CODE --> <!-- STEP 3: Define column & row positioning --> <!-- STEP 4: Add Styling for BUTTON --> <!-- STEP 2: Add BUTTON CODE --></p>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;!-- Add GRID CODE --&gt;

&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto"/&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height="*"/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;

    &lt;Grid Margin="12"&gt;
        &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*" /&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" /&gt;
        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;!-- STEP 1: Add DropDownButton &amp; ToggleSwitch CODE --&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
    
    &lt;Grid x:Name="Control1" Grid.Row="1" ColumnSpacing="30" RowSpacing="12"

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Setting up remaining controls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 1: Add DropDownButton &amp; ToggleSwitch:</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 2: Add Buttons:</span>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;Button Background="#FF0000" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Content="Kick 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#C4425A" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1" Content="Kick 2"/&gt;

&lt;Button Background="#473DB8" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="3" Content="Clap 4"/&gt;

&lt;Button Background="#D41DD8" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="0" Content="Open Hat 1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#6A21A3" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="1" Content="Open Hat 2"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#473DB8" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="2" Content="Open Hat 3"/&gt;
&lt;Button Background="#26AAC7" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="3" Content="Open Hat 4"/&gt;

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Developing for Windows 11</h2>
Windows 11 was built to unlock the full power of the PC. This new operating system empowers you to deliver new and innovative apps, grow your business how you choose, and makes developing on Windows easier by allowing you to use the tools and frameworks you already use and know. Windows 11 is our most open platform yet and it gives you the ability to build and run the widest range of apps. We can’t wait to see what you build for your users to learn, create, and play. Here are the key updates you should know about:
<ul>
 	<li>The new Microsoft Store;</li>
 	<li>Advancements and updates for web and native development; and</li>
 	<li>Updates to our Fluent design system</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Grow your business with the new Microsoft Store</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56401 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/Picture1.png" alt="" width="1430" height="959" /></strong></h3>
<em>Image 1: The new Microsoft Store </em>

The <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176287">new Microsoft Store</a> is more open and allows you and your customers to be more productive and easily find the best apps. The new <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">Store focuses on openness, fairness, and innovation</a>. This means more apps are available in the store without having to update business models or re-write apps; more apps are discoverable due to updated policies that allow standalone digital storefront apps to be found via search, and to encourage innovation we’re enabling you to bring your own browser engine so you can innovate how you chose. This is the start of our journey, and we hope you’ll continue to engage with us so we can continue to provide access to broader markets and opportunities.
<h3><strong>Streamline your Web and native app development </strong></h3>
Windows 11 was built with developers in mind – to create a platform that provides a seamless development experience no matter what app you are building. We continue to learn from our past and understand the vision, innovation, and creativity can truly thrive when tools, features, and experiences are easy to use. That’s why we’ve taken steps to make developing on Windows easier.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56398 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/image1.png" alt="" width="1356" height="495" />

<span class="TextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0">Image 2: Microsoft Edge DevTools in a variety of color</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0"> themes</span></em><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187909126 BCX0"><em>.</em> </span></span><span class="EOP SCXW187909126 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> is now part of the operating system for everyone. We’ve significantly improved performance and reduced the disk footprint, memory usage, and launch time of your WebView2 apps by hard linking with the Edge browser. And, for those of you building Progressive Web Apps, we’ve improved the desktop integration and user experience with new standards-based and experimental capabilities. You can now integrate your apps more seamlessly with the desktop by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#window-controls-overlay-for-installed-desktop-web-apps">customizing the titlebar</a>, registering as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#uri-protocol-handling">default handler for links</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#uri-protocol-handling">protocols</a>, and even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features/#file-handling">handling files on the user’s filesystem</a>. Of course, you can continue to use offerings like Windows Terminal and our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/09/14/edge-devtools-93-personalization/">Microsoft Edge DevTools</a> themes to match the visual experience found throughout Windows 11.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Windows App SDK</a> and WinUI 3 represent the latest in native app development for Windows 11, and they empower you to build the most productive desktop apps in the world. The Windows App SDK 1.0 Preview 1 brings many new developments, including support for the MSAL library, AppInstance APIs for handling and redirecting activation, AppWindow APIs for managing your window regardless of what UI stack you’re using, performance and reliability improvements, and much more.

With Windows 11, we’ve made it easier for you to run your apps on Windows on ARM.  You can run your unmodified x64 apps using emulation, or you can compile your apps natively for ARM64 for the best possible performance on these devices. Windows 11 on ARM also introduces the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/porting/arm64ec">ARM64 Emulation</a> Compatible ABI which enables you to build apps that can contain or load both ARM64EC and x64 code, allowing you to incrementally migrate existing x64 apps to run natively on ARM64 over time.
<h3><strong>Refresh your apps and experiences </strong></h3>
Windows 11 is the first major <a href="https://aka.ms/windows11design">redesign of Windows</a> and we did it to bring the operating system closer to the ecosystem of products that are being created at Microsoft.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56399 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/10/image2.gif" alt="" width="624" height="351" />

<em><span class="TextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">Image </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">3</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">: </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">Microsoft Fluent Design</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0"> showing examples of </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">rounded geometry, </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW159786446 BCX0">acrylic, mica, and our new typography and iconography.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW159786446 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></em>

Windows 11 feels more modern and beautiful. The subtle change of rounding our geometry across all of the UI surfaces makes Windows feel more approachable and your apps easier to scan, which helps your customers stay more engaged. Some of the visual updates in Windows 11 will be inherited by apps with no additional code changes, but to benefit from all these visual updates, some work will be required. We recommend you focus on three areas:
<ul>
 	<li>Use UI with rounded geometry. This can be applied to both the non-client area and to the client area of the app.</li>
 	<li>Apply the refreshed color palette and materials. The new color palette is applied automatically to our latest WinUI controls (WinUI 2.6 or greater required), apps that use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/style/acrylic">acrylic</a> can switch to the latest brush, and our new material <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/style/mica">Mica</a> lets the wallpaper image shine through the frame of your app.</li>
 	<li>Update to our typography and iconography. Windows 11 delivers two new system icons. To incorporate the evolved Segoe UI, you need WinUI 2.6 (or greater), and your controls will automatically inherit the latest font family. To use the Segoe Variable UI, you should point to “Segoe UI Variable” in any instance that references “Segoe UI”.</li>
</ul>
Windows 11 is the next generation of Windows, and the entire experience was reimagined with you and your users in mind. We wanted a platform that would feel like home – centered on you but with more openness and security. We can’t wait to see what you build.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In June, we <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">introduced the new Microsoft Store</a> on Windows, redesigned from the ground up to meet the needs of customers across a variety of app experiences. We also opened up the Microsoft Store on Windows to developers using different types of frameworks, packaging technologies, and commerce platforms – in alignment with <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/">our commitment to choice, fairness, and innovation</a>.

The new Microsoft Store will launch to the public alongside Windows 11 on October 5<sup>th</sup>. It will also be available to Windows 10 customers in the coming months.

As we continue our journey, we are grateful for the response from the app developer ecosystem, and we will continue to listen to their feedback. Today, we would like to recognize some of the new apps that are now available in the Microsoft Store and share some updates to our policies for third-party stores.
<h3><strong>Opening to more apps</strong></h3>
Developers told us they love not having to re-write their existing desktop apps or change their business models in order to be part of the Microsoft Store on Windows. Since June, hundreds of app developers have <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blogsourcenewstore">registered</a> to our preview program to bring their desktop apps onboard. An initial wave of new desktop apps that you can try today on the Windows 11 Insider Preview includes communication platforms like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDC2RH70K22MN">Discord</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP99J3KP4XZ4VV">Zoom Cloud Meetings</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9K178L5G0JQ0">KakaoTalk</a>, and creativity-focused tools such as <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9mwxf9hmhzrz">Luminar AI</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9MFVKXKKTD8M" data-wplink-url-error="true">Music Maker</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDDTKMZ5N9Q41">VLC</a>. Desktop productivity applications, like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDM17HK323C4X">TeamViewer</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XPDP273C0XHQH2">Adobe Acrobat Reader DC,</a> and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9MWJQ9TX63F9">LibreOffice</a>, are also available for download and are joined by new additions from inside Microsoft, like <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP89DCGQ3K6VLD">Microsoft PowerToys</a>, <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q">Visual Studio Code</a>, and <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP8CDJNZKFM06W">Visual Studio Community</a>.

Furthermore, several high-quality Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are also now available in the Microsoft Store on Windows, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NS3RBQ5HV5F">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFHWM4">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/tiktok/9nh2gph4jzs4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJKS5V4V997">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PLHCT3922NQ">Quizlet</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NTDQP5CQG07">Tumblr</a>. PWAs on Windows allow developers to <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">bring the best of their web experiences</a> even closer to their customers, for example by easy access in the taskbar or Start menu, icon notification badging, or matching the user preference on light/dark theme mode. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/clipchamp-the-best-free-video-editor-for-creators-sales-and-marketing/9p1j8s7ccwwt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Clipchamp</a>, available for free on the Microsoft Store, is a video editor with a deep feature set and seamless web-sharing workflow. Now part of the Microsoft family, Clipchamp is a great example of what Windows developers can deliver using PWA as a foundation.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56396 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/PDP_wipe_09-28-21_alt_1920x1080_latest.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" />
<h3><strong>Opening to other stores</strong></h3>
Our commitment to being an ‘open Store for an open platform’ isn’t just about the various technical underpinnings of how apps are built. It’s also about making sure our business terms are fair and help promote innovation. For instance, the Microsoft Store on Windows no longer requires app developers to share revenue with Microsoft, when apps manage their own in-app payment systems.

In that spirit, today we’re <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies?redirectedfrom=MSDN">announcing another significant update to our Microsoft Store on Windows policies</a>, which will allow third-party storefront apps to be discoverable in the Microsoft Store on Windows. Just like any other app, third-party storefront apps will have a product detail page that can be found via search or by browsing – so that users can easily find and install it with the same confidence as any other app in the Microsoft Store on Windows. Today, we are sharing that Amazon and Epic Games will bring their storefront apps to the Microsoft Store over the next few months, and we look forward to welcoming other stores as well in the future.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56388 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image2-1.png" alt="" width="1429" height="804" />

<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">As we shared back in August</a>, we’re excited about the journey we’re on to bring Android apps and games to Windows 11, including the ability to discover and search the Amazon Appstore catalog directly in the Microsoft Store. This will start as a preview for Windows Insiders soon; we will share soon more details about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications">system requirements</a> and market availability of the preview experience, and we look forward to the engagement and feedback with the Windows Insiders community.
<h3><strong>Opening to other browsers</strong></h3>
In June, we updated our policies for browser apps, enabling developers to bring their own browser engines (instead of relying on the OS’ web platform) and continue to innovate with their user experience. Today we are welcoming two browsers, joining Microsoft Edge in the Microsoft Store on Windows: Opera and Yandex Browser.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56391 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/Opera_PDP_4.6_G3.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2178" />
<h3><strong>Opening to your apps</strong></h3>
Our journey has just started, and we look forward to continuing to work together with the developer ecosystem to deliver even more great experiences for the Microsoft Store on Windows. You can learn <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/?utm_campaign=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blogsourcenewstore">how to publish your app to the new Microsoft Store on Windows here,</a> as well as catch the latest docs and best practices to reach new customers.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Announcing Windows Community Toolkit v7.1</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Windows Community Toolkit has another update filled with improvements and features! We’re thrilled to announce version 7.1 is available today! Made possible again with the support and contributions of our developer community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎉</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are new to the Toolkit, the Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helpers, extensions, and custom controls. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks for building UWP and .NET apps for Windows. The toolkit is part of the .NET Foundation. You can </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">download our Sample App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> playground to discover and try Toolkit components before getting started on a project.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56358 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1375" height="770" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This update includes authentication helpers, Microsoft Graph controls, the easiest way to add Shadows to your app in XAML, a new RichSuggestBox control, and more! We even have a preview of source generator support for our MVVM Toolkit library.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve had a lot of exciting news this year too. Be sure to catch up on what we’re doing with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows App SDK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our previous post about </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct-winui3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our WinUI 3 release here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (back when it was still called Project Reunion). We’ll have more updates for this in the future – WinAppSDK has just released their <a title="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FWindowsAppSDK%2Fdiscussions%2F1437&data=04%7C01%7Cmichael.hawker%40microsoft.com%7Ccd42f4037ade446fa47908d97eb48434%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637680137737617368%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=NpihnnRXr5u3kpSWeqsCbWZNxUFYdVXV6Zgtyth6BP4%3D&reserved=0" href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FWindowsAppSDK%2Fdiscussions%2F1437&data=04%7C01%7Cmichael.hawker%40microsoft.com%7Ccd42f4037ade446fa47908d97eb48434%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637680137737617368%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=NpihnnRXr5u3kpSWeqsCbWZNxUFYdVXV6Zgtyth6BP4%3D&reserved=0">1.0 Preview 1 release</a> so as they reach their 1.0 release, <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCommunityToolkit%2FWindowsCommunityToolkit%2Fdiscussions%2F3912&data=04%7C01%7Cmichael.hawker%40microsoft.com%7Ccd42f4037ade446fa47908d97eb48434%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637680137737627336%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Diz4YBCbzBdCuiDVskZ%2BX3xF%2FEdMXJQXAomYY38X6Ow%3D&reserved=0">stay tuned here</a> for updates.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We’ve also expanded our organization to work with the MAUI Community Toolkit and will be splitting our .NET specific libraries to their own .NET Community Toolkit soon, </span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/welcome-to-the-community-toolkit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read all about that here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

See more details of these changes and new features below.</span>
<h3><strong>Microsoft Identity Authentication Helpers, OneDrive Storage, and Microsoft Graph Controls - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/shweaver-MSFT">Shane Weaver</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New and improved for 7.1, our Microsoft Graph offering is moving out of its prior preview phase and has been overhauled and streamlined with new helpers and providers for authenticating with Microsoft Identity and calling Graph APIs. We received a lot of great feedback from the community that we hope will help devs hit the ground running, authenticating users, and calling </span><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Graph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> APIs!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56359 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image3.png" alt="" width="1425" height="831" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, be sure to check out our full </span><a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Sample-Graph-ContosoNotes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ContosoNotes sample</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which shows how these APIs can be leveraged and create a great experience for users across their applications and devices.</span>
<h3><strong>Authentication Providers </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this release we are introducing a variety of new authentication packages:</span>
<table style="height: 258px;" width="1230">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Package</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core constructs for supporting authentication aware applications.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication.Msal</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication provider based on the official Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET SDK.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Authentication.Uwp</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication provider based on the native account management APIs in Windows.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MsalProvider available in the *.Msal package is .NET Standard 2.0 and works across multiple systems. This provider is better for supporting cross-platform or complex authentication scenarios. For UWP apps, try the WindowsProvider for a lighter-weight package.</span>
<h3><strong>Graph Powered Controls and OneDrive Helpers</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we are re-introducing our Graph controls and helpers in the form of two new packages:</span>
<table style="height: 201px;" width="1012">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Package</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Graph</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensions and helpers for making adhoc Graph requests, leveraging the official Graph SDK for .NET.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.Graph.Uwp</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows specific helpers and controls for facilitating authentication flow and visualizing Graph data.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The *.Graph package includes Graph powered extensions and helpers for interacting with the Graph SDK for .NET and making authenticated requests to Graph APIs:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Extensions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Call GetClient() or GetBetaClient() on any IProvider instance to get access to a pre-configured GraphServiceClient on demand.</span></li>
 	<li><b>OneDriveStorageHelper and UserExtensionStorageHelper</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – New helpers for storing settings and file data in Graph based storage locations, such as OneDrive or open extensions on the Graph User object.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the *.Graph.Uwp package has user controls and helpers for enhancing Graph powered UWP apps:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Controls</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – LoginButton, PeoplePicker, and PersonView (GraphPresenter is still experimental.)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>ProviderStateTrigger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – A StateTrigger for detecting when the global authentication provider has been signed in.</span></li>
 	<li><b>ElementExtensions.IsVisibleWhen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Extension on FrameworkElement for declaring element visibility behavior in response to authentication changes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Attached Shadows - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/Ryken100">Chris Blackman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michael-hawker">Michael Hawker</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Move over DropShadowPanel and hello Attached Shadows! Attached shadows make it even easier to add this great depth effect to your app, now without having to modify your layout! </span><a href="https://twitter.com/justinxinliu/status/1425642561763377152"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re even used in the Microsoft Store App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56366 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/StoreImage.jpg" alt="Microsoft Store home page" width="1920" height="1080" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DropShadowPanel is one of the Toolkit’s most popular controls, but its big issue is that it needs to wrap around the content you want to have the shadow on. This makes adding shadows later in development tricky as it affects how you’ve laid out an entire element.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with an attached shadow, you can sprinkle them in afterward wherever they’re needed. They can even be applied in styles to update multiple elements in your app at once! And they even hook into the new XAML Animation system we shipped last release, so everything works seamlessly together!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of these attached shadows in this release: the AttachedCardShadow and the AttachedDropShadow. Read our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/docs/attachedshadow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which outlines where it is best to use each type of shadow.</span>
<h3><strong>AttachedCardShadow using Win2D</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The AttachedCardShadow is a rectangular-based shadow (which supports rounded corners) that can be applied directly to an element without the need for any other configuration. It should be your new go-to shadow option if you don’t mind the Win2D dependency it requires.</span>
<h3><strong>AttachedDropShadow using Composition</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The AttachedDropShadow supports masked shadows for transparent images, shapes, and text. It uses the composition layer, so it’ll work with any UWP app. It has inherited the implementation of DropShadowPanel, but it works a bit differently. Be sure to check out our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/docs/attachedshadow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">samples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more.</span>
<h3><strong>RichSuggestBox - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/huynhsontung">Tung Huynh</a></strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56362 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image5.png" alt="" width="915" height="248" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The RichSuggestBox is a RichEditBox that provides the additional functionality of being able to select tokens from a list of suggestions, like ‘@’ mentioning someone in a chat message or tagging a document to include in a note. It provides a similar pattern that our TokenizingTextBox control provides, but instead of just being for a set of fixed elements it allows for more free-form text input sprinkled with metadata.</span>
<h2><strong>WinUI 2.7 and other Improvements!</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve updated to base on control packages on the new WinUI 2.6 and 2.7 update which also includes updated styles. We’ll continue to update our control styles with the new design guidance over time.</span>

<h2><strong>On The Horizon</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>MVVM Source Generator [Preview] - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/sergio0694">Sergio Pedri</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MVVM Toolkit now has support for </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (in preview). This makes the library more flexible, easier to use, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more efficient</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following is a small sample of some source generator attributes in action. On the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">left-hand side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the original hand-written example using the MVVM Toolkit, as you would today. On the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-hand side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is how you can use the new attributes to automatically generate the exact same code!</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56363 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image4.png" alt="" width="1429" height="564" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can already see the impact Source Generators can have to save you from having to write extra “boiler-plate” type code! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">🤯</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brand-new feature is being developed with the same original core principles of the MVVM Toolkit in mind: being modular and “à la carte”. This means source generator support is bundled with the MVVM Toolkit, but still being completely optional: you’ll be free to use it everywhere, mix & match as needed, or ignore it altogether; it’s entirely up to you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of the new features:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableProperty]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute creates a super compact way of creating an observable property from just a field and annotation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[AlsoNotifyChangeFor]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be used to raise a change notification for another dependent property.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ICommand]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute will let you annotate methods in a ViewModel and generate all the corresponding command properties. This includes support for generic commands and asynchronous commands: just annotate an async method returning a Task!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also annotate a class with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[INotifyPropertyChanged]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableObject]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableRecipient]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableValidator]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to inject all the boilerplate code needed to use those MVVM helpers while still inheriting from other base classes! You can also use this to mix together inheriting from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ObservableRecipient</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then add the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ObservableValidator]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute to combine all APIs from both classes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s more planned for the future, both in terms of new features and performance improvements!</span>
<h3><strong>Introducing Toolkit Labs 🧪</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Windows Community Toolkit has grown, we’ve raised the bar on the quality of our code and the process we use for vetting new features being introduced. This helps our community know they’re getting quality items in each of our releases, but it can slow down the pace at which we can innovate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation has been the life of the Toolkit. Rapidly prototyping ideas, gathering community feedback, and shipping things folks need have been instrumental to how the Toolkit works. For this reason, we’re introducing “Community Toolkit Labs”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Labs will be a place where we can incubate and work on new features in a safe space outside our normal code base and ship cycles. It’ll be easier to get started working on code and collaborating with others before having to worry about the docs, samples, and tests required to ship a fully fleshed-out idea and feature within the Toolkit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, we plan to have a centralized Labs repository for smaller features and controls to be proposed, incubated, and worked in with the community. Be on the lookout for more info about this new space in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have a dedicated NuGet feed for Toolkit Labs in our public DevOps package feed. You can find out more about these types of </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct/wiki/previewpackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preview Feeds on our Wiki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also have larger ideas that have their own repository underneath the Labs banner, like the first ones we’re introducing today…</span>
<h3><strong>Intelligent APIs - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/amrutha95">Amrutha Srinivasan</a></strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56365 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/09/image7.jpg" alt="" width="927" height="517" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Intelligent APIs” is a project whose goal is to make machine learning easier for developers to leverage in their applications without needing ML expertise! By just importing a NuGet package and calling a function, we want developers to be able to build intelligent app experiences without needing to deal with the complexities of creating and using machine learning models on Windows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently experimenting with this concept by wrapping two existing state-of-the-art models into NuGet packages. They enable the developer to add image classification and object detection capabilities quickly and easily into their projects with a single function call.</span>

<a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-IntelligentAPIs"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about how to get started with Intelligent APIs here.</span></i></a>

<h3><strong>Gaze Controls - 🏆 <a href="https://github.com/harishsk">Harish Kulkarni</a></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These new Gaze Controls can empower users whose primary form of input is to use their eyes. These controls have been designed for Gaze interaction first above other forms of input. They include a FilePicker, a Keyboard, and a Scrollbar. Find out more or contribute to </span><a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-GazeControls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their dedicated repo here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><strong>Windows App SDK Previews (formally Project Reunion)</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you hopefully know, we have been shipping versions of the Toolkit that work for WinUI 3 alongside their releases as part of the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows App SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have released a version of the toolkit which works for Desktop apps with .NET for the Windows App SDK 0.8.4 release. </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wct-winui3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more details on how to try this out here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a reminder these WinUI 3 based packages use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommunityToolkit.WinUI.*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the root vs. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft.Toolkit.UWP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll have more info about the upcoming 1.0 release support in the future and plan to ship an update that includes our 7.1 changes as well.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows 11 brings refinement to contextual file operations in the right-click context menu and share dialog. These are extensible by apps, including unpackaged Win32 apps. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The context menu is one of the most popular and useful shell extensions. If you are already in File Explorer or on the Desktop, it significantly reduces the number of steps to complete a file operation compared to opening a separate app.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As useful as the Windows 10 context menu is, there are aspects of its design we sought to improve in Windows 11.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common commands - cut, copy, paste, delete, and rename - are far from the mouse pointer, touch point, or pen.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The menu is exceptionally long. It has grown in an unregulated environment for 20 years, since Windows XP, when IContextMenu was introduced.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes commands which are rarely used.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands that should be grouped together – such as Open and Open with – are sometimes far apart.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps have no common organizational schema and can interrupt sections of inbox commands.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commands added by apps are not attributable to the app itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many commands run in-process in Explorer, which can cause performance and reliability issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56314 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/W10-Context-Menu-with-Contoso-Replacements-and-Defender-Fix-458x1024.png" alt="" width="458" height="1024" />

<strong>The Windows 11 context menu addresses these problems in the following ways:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common commands are placed right next to where the menu is invoked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open” and “Open with” are grouped together.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps extend the menu with IExplorerCommand + app identity. Unpackaged Win32 apps can use </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparse Manifests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. IExplorerCommand support extends back to Windows 7.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">App extensions are grouped together below Shell verbs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cfapi/build-a-cloud-file-sync-engine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Files provider apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are placed next to the Shell commands to hydrate or dehydrate the file.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps with more than 1 verb are grouped into a flyout with app attribution.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Show more options” loads the Windows 10 context menu as-is for access to low-use Shell verbs and apps still working on porting over. No commands have been removed entirely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shift-F10 or the keyboard menu key will also load the Windows 10 context menu.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56293" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image3.png" alt="" width="648" height="1060" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The share dialog has also been improved in Windows 11.</strong> </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby sharing is now much easier to use, with easy control over your discoverability setting up top and a link to more settings in the footer of the dialog.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use the Mail app, the first entry in the contacts list helps you easily send an email to yourself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All apps can now participate in the Share dialog as targets. For unpackaged Win32 apps, this is covered in </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/tree/master/Samples/SparsePackages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same sample</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the context menu. PWAs installed through Microsoft Edge are also supported if they implement the Web Share Target API.</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56294" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/07/image2.png" alt="" width="799" height="1104" />
<h3><b>Context Menu Best Practices</b></h3>
<b>Regarding File Opening scenarios:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. When should I register my app for “Open with”? (File Type associations)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new context menu moves “Open with” to the top of the menu, right next to “Open.” </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app can open the file to do something more with it, you should always register for any applicable File Type Associations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Universal openers,” like technical text editors, should register to handle *</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so they will always be offered as an “Open with” option. They should also explicitly register for any filetypes they are optimized to handle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. When should I add a verb to “Edit with (app)”?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common for certain file types to be both “viewable/runnable” and “editable,” such as scripts, HTML, images, or text-based document formats. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the default action on double-click for these files can be “open/run” or “edit,” one of these two actions will be less convenient.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these cases, adding a verb for “Edit with (app name)” is an acceptable practice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, please consider if your non-power-users will be adequately served by “Open with.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these users, a default state of not including the verb unless users opt into it will keep the menu tidier in general while offering classic functionality to your power users.</span></p>
<b>Regarding File Sharing scenarios:</b><b>
</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. When should I add a Context Menu verb to “Share with (app)”?</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share actions can originate outside of File Explorer, for example the Photos app or Snip &amp; Sketch. In these cases, the Share dialog is shown to the user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best practice is to make sure you are registered as an app target in the Share dialog. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also OK to add a Context Menu verb for “Share with (app)”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Share dialog is also easily accessed from the File Explorer ribbon and context menu, an additional “Share with” verb in the context menu can be redundant - consider offering a way for users to opt out of the duplicate context menu verb.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we’re announcing ARM64EC (“Emulation Compatible”), a new way to build apps for Windows 11 on ARM. With the latest Visual Studio tools in preview and the Windows 11 Insider SDK, you'll be able to take advantage of ARM64EC to incrementally transition your app to running with native speed on ARM, even if you have dependencies or plugins that don't support ARM yet.
<h3>About ARM64EC</h3>
ARM64EC is a new application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM's built-in emulation.

The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the existing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160">ARM64 ABI</a> in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.
<h3>Developer Benefits</h3>
Traditionally, rebuilding an app for ARM has meant recompiling the entire app. The result is a great native experience for the customer that unlocks the full power of the ARM device. However, from a developer perspective, porting an app can be all-or-nothing, since all the binaries within a process need to be rebuilt before a customer can see the benefit.

With ARM64EC, you can choose to start small and build incrementally. You can identify a part of your codebase that would benefit most from native performance and rebuild it as ARM64EC. The rest of the app will remain fully functional as emulated x64, but the recompiled ARM64EC parts will now have native speed.  Over time, you can recompile more of the app as ARM64EC to further improve performance and conserve battery life for your app’s customers.

The ability to mix and match x64 and ARM64EC makes it possible to build an app for Windows 11 on ARM even if it depends on x64 code outside of your control. Projects with third-party dependencies that don't support ARM can leave them as x64.  And apps with an in-proc plugin ecosystem can build as ARM64EC to get native speed, while continuing to load and use x64 plugins.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
We're motivated by the potential of ARM64EC and excited to see the kinds of apps developers can build for Windows 11 on ARM using this technology. Internally, we’ve rebuilt the binaries of the Windows 11 on ARM operating system itself with ARM64EC so that any system code loaded by x64 apps runs with native speed.  In addition, the Office team is using ARM64EC in the coming <a href="https://aka.ms/officeforwindowsarmblog">64-bit Office for ARM</a> so that existing x64 plugins will work seamlessly.

You can get started with ARM64EC by downloading the latest <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">Windows Insider SDK</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/">Visual Studio Preview</a>, then following the steps on <a href="https://aka.ms/arm64ecgettingstarted">docs.microsoft.com</a> to add an ARM64EC configuration.  Looking forward, we'll have more content to share as we walk through in more detail how to take advantage of ARM64EC in your apps.]]></content:encoded>
