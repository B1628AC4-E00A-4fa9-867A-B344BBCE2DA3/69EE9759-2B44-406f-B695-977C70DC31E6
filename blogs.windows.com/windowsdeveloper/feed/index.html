										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">Sandboxing Python can be very useful for developers but has been challenging due to the flexibility of CPython implementation. It is particularly useful in many scenarios to have sandboxed Python.  For example, on any website that needs to execute arbitrary code from users, like coding practice sites or online interpreters. It could also be useful to help prevent increasing attacks on LLMs (Large Language Models).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Win32 App Isolation (https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation) lights up a different path to sandboxing Python – not on a Python library level, but on an application/OS level.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Win32 App Isolation is designed to isolate Win32 application by creating a security boundary between the application and the OS, using the combination of AppContainer, virtualized resources and brokering file system, which helps to prevent the application from compromising the operating system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Following are the specifics requirements and guidance for sandboxing</span> <span data-contrast="auto">CPython with Win32 App Isolation on recent Windows Insider releases. It takes about 30-60 minutes and anyone with the insider version of Windows can do it on their local machine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">To use Win32 App Isolation, you need the insider version of Windows with version number &gt; 25357, and the MSIX Packaging Tool from https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/releases/</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step One:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Download the Python installer for Windows from python.org. 3.12.2 was used for this specific example.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step Two:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Package it by following the documentation (</span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/packaging/msix-packaging-tool.md"><span data-contrast="none">https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/packaging/msix-packaging-tool.md</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">). You may need a certificate to sign the package to install it (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/create-app-package#signing-preference).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Add <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">isolatedWin32-PromptForAccess </code></span><span data-contrast="auto">capability for demonstration purposes, so you can allow it to access certain resources in prompts. Without the capability, all access to the user files that are not explicitly set to be available to the application would be denied.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Add an alias <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">python3.12.exe </code></span><span data-contrast="auto">to use it from PowerShell.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Step Three:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Install the package. Use the defined alias <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">python3.12.exe</code> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in PowerShell to bring up the Python interpreter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56928 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/02/1.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer" width="624" height="355" />

<span data-contrast="auto">When starting the Python interpreter, it will prompt you to ask permission to the current working directory. Python itself would be brought up with either option – but this determines whether Python has access to the files in the current directory.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">For example, if you clicked “No” here, you would not be able to list the files in the current directory anymore:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56930 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/02/Picture2.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer" width="624" height="356" />

<span data-contrast="auto">The selection will be remembered so the application will only prompt once for any file/folder. The user can reset the file permissions in Settings – Privacy &amp; security – File system:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> <img class="alignnone wp-image-56931 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/02/Picture3.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer" width="624" height="466" /></span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The Python interpreter should work well on its own given no code has been changed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56932 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/02/Picture4.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer" width="624" height="356" />

<span data-contrast="auto">The more interesting aspects to check out are the “sandboxing” features – network and file system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">But before that, try to execute a script using isolated Python.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56933 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/02/Picture5.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer" width="624" height="357" />

<span data-contrast="auto">As you are trying to access and execute a user file (the script), it will prompt for the access. If denied, the script will not run:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Allow it to review some examples, starting with network access.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">As you did not provide any network capabilities when packaging, Python will not have any access to the network. Confirm this by running this script:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Also try to access the file system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">From the examples above, by introducing Win32 App Isolation you can help prevent Python from accessing the file system and the network without consent.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">There are two obvious questions:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>
<ol>
 	<li>How can you “click” the prompts if you want to deploy this on your server? As mentioned above, <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">isolatedWin32-promptForAccess</code>is only added for demonstration purposes, and it is not needed for isolation. Without it, your system would simply deny any access to user files, thus helping to prevent attacks like ransomware.</li>
 	<li>Then how can you grant access to the application for required files like modules, scripts, and data? There are several ways to do it:<span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>
<ul>
 	<li>You can package the modules you need into your app, then they will be accessible by default.</li>
 	<li>You can put the file you need access to into the app’s profile in <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">%localappdata%</code> where the app is granted access automatically.</li>
 	<li>You can put the file to a “publisher directory”, which is any directory with a name ending with your app’s publisher ID in <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">c:\ProgramData</code>. (<a style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px); background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/fundamentals/consent.md"><span data-contrast="none">win32-app-isolation/docs/fundamentals/consent.md at main · microsoft/win32-app-isolation (github.com)</span></a><span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);" data-contrast="auto">)</span></li>
 	<li>You can set the access of files and directories with icalcs to allow your app or all apps to access them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<span data-contrast="auto">With the technology, the users can create much lighter solutions when they try to execute code from an untrusted source. Isolated Python can live in parallel with normal Python and perform as a low-privilege interpreter on the side. Or, with correct configuration, it can be used on its own which could help protect the system from being compromised while keeping all the functionalities from Python.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A developer preview of DirectML support for Intel® AI boost</h3>
With the release of DirectML 1.13.1 and the ONNX Runtime 1.17, we are excited to announce developer preview support for NPU acceleration in DirectML, the machine learning platform API for Windows. This developer preview enables support for a subset of models on new Windows 11 devices with Intel® Core™ Ultra processors with Intel® AI boost.

This initial release was developed using open source models and in close partnership with our launch partner, Samsung. "NPUs are emerging as a critical resource for broadly delivering efficient machine learning experiences to users, and Windows DirectML is one of the most efficient ways for Samsung's developers to make those experiences for Windows," said Hwang-Yoon Shim, VP and Head of New Computing H/W R&amp;D Group at Samsung Electronics.

DirectML is a low-level API that provides a common abstraction layer for hardware vendors to expose their machine learning accelerators. DirectML works with any DirectX 12-compatible device including GPUs and now NPUs. Support for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors with Intel® AI Boost was developed in close collaboration with Intel®. You can read about the latest from Intel® in their latest technical blog: <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Artificial-Intelligence-AI/Scaling-AI-in-Samsung-PCs-with-Intel-AI-Boost-and-Microsoft/post/1565905">Scaling AI in Samsung PCs with Intel® AI Boost and Microsoft</a>.

With this developer preview, DirectML targets the NPU on new Intel® Core™ Ultra devices and runs a subset of machine learning models that are optimized for NPU acceleration. NPU support in DirectML is a work in progress and we are eager to hear your feedback and learn from your experiences.

“We are excited to enable our developer community to harness the power of the industry’s first NPU with DirectML support on Intel® Core™ Ultra processors! These exciting AI features and capabilities are only possible thanks for our deep partnership with Microsoft’s Windows AI team, and we’re looking forward to continuing this partnership and realizing many more exciting AI experiences!”, said Michael Langan, Senior Director of Engineering &amp; General Manager NPU, Intel®.
<h1>Getting started with NPU support in DirectML</h1>
To use NPU support in DirectML, you need the following:
<ul>
 	<li>A Windows 11 device with an Intel® Core™ Ultra processor with Intel® AI boost.</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML">DirectML 1.13.1</a> NuGet package, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases">ONNX Runtime 1.17</a>, and the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/794734/intel-npu-driver-windows.html">latest NPU driver</a> from Intel®.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Limitations of this developer preview</h1>
This developer preview is an early release that is intended to give you a glimpse of the future of DirectML with NPU support.
<ul>
 	<li>NPU support in DirectML is only available for Intel® Core™ Ultra processers with Intel® AI Boost at this time.</li>
 	<li>NPU support in DirectML is currently only compatible with a subset of machine learning models that have been targeted for support. Some models may not run at all or may have high latency or low accuracy. We are working to improve the compatibility and performance of more models in the future.</li>
 	<li>Models that are functional and were not selected for this developer preview may have some stability and reliability issues. We are continuing to expand coverage for additional models suitable for NPU.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Intel®, one of our key partners, to bring the first Neural Processing Unit (NPU) powered by DirectML on Windows. AI is transforming the world, driving innovation and creating value across industries. NPUs are critical components in enabling amazing AI experiences for developers and consumers alike.

An NPU is a processor built for enabling machine learning (ML) workloads that are computationally intensive, do not require graphics interactions, and provide efficient power consumption. These new devices will revolutionize how AI transforms our day-to-day experiences. We are excited to share that early next year we will release the DirectML support for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors with Intel® AI Boost, the new integrated NPU.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56912 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/12/DML-1-224x300.png" alt="DirectML Platform overview" width="224" height="300" />DirectML is a low-level, hardware abstracted API that provides direct access to hardware capabilities of modern devices, such as GPUs, for ML workloads. It is part of the DirectX family—the Windows graphics and gaming platform—and is designed to integrate with other DirectX components, such as DirectX12. DirectML integrates with popular ML and tooling frameworks, such as the cross-platform inference engine, the ONNX Runtime and Olive, the Windows optimization tooling framework for ML models, thus simplifying the development and deployment of AI experiences across the Windows ecosystem.

By extending the hardware acceleration capabilities to include NPU support in DirectML, we are opening new possibilities for AI on Windows. DirectML with NPU support will be in developer preview in early 2024, along with the latest ONNX Runtime release, with broadening support over 2024. Stay tuned for more announcements with key partners, expanded capabilities and how to use DirectML for NPUs.

We can't wait to see the amazing AI experiences you will create on Windows, with DirectML on Intel® Core™ Ultra processors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the latest Windows 11 update on Sept. 26 we released a host of developer features as the core component of the Windows OS with an intent to make every developer more productive on Windows. Today we are excited to announce Windows AI Studio, a new AI experience to help enterprises and developers jumpstart local AI development and deployment on Windows, along with new updates to Dev Home and new enterprise features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that enhance security and simplify deployment.
<h3><strong>Windows AI Studio simplifies generative AI app development</strong></h3>
Many developers and enterprises want to bring AI differentiated experiences to their apps and we have heard from these developers that they need an easier and trusted way to get started with local AI development. With many tools, frameworks and open-source models available it is difficult to pick the right set of tools to test, fine-tune and optimize the models or select the most trusted models that best fit diverse business needs. That’s why we are thrilled to announce Windows AI Studio, a new experience for developers, that extends the tooling of Azure AI Studio to jumpstart AI development locally on Windows.
<h3><strong>Getting started with AI development locally on Windows is easier and faster than ever</strong></h3>
<a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio</a> simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from Azure AI Studio and other catalogs like Hugging Face, enabling developers to fine-tune, customize and deploy state-of-the-art small language models, or SLMs, for local use in their Windows apps. This includes an e2e guided workspace setup that includes model configuration UI and guided walkthroughs to fine-tune popular SLMs like Phi. Developers can then rapidly test their fine-tuned model using the Prompt Flow and Gradio templates integrated into the workspace.

Windows AI Studio brings us closer to supporting Hybrid Loop development patterns and enabling hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. This gives developers greater choice either to run their models on the cloud on Azure or on the edge locally on Windows (or across the two) to meet their needs. Prompt Flow makes it easier than ever to implement this hybrid pattern by switching between local SLMs and cloud LLMs.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56895 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/11/Model-flow-dark1920-1024x289.png" alt="Graph showing a typical fine-tuning workflow" width="1024" height="289" />

The picture above shows a typical fine-tuning workflow. Developers will bring their own datasets for fine-tuning. See our fine-tuning guide for details on how to get started. Note that the fine-tuning + model evaluation steps will be iterative until the model meets the developers’ evaluation criteria.

In the coming weeks developers can access <a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio">Windows AI Studio as a VS Code Extension</a>, a familiar and seamless interface to help you get started with AI development. The guided interface allows you to focus on what you do best, coding, while we do all the heavy lifting by setting your developer environment with all the tools needed. <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/ai">Learn more</a> about Windows AI Studio.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56896 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/11/Step-11920-1024x548.jpg" alt="Windows AI Studio Step 1: Select model" width="1024" height="548" />

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56898 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/11/Step-31920-1024x548.jpg" alt="Windows AI Studio Step 3: Generating project" width="1024" height="548" />
<h3><strong>Windows optimized state-of-the-art models</strong></h3>
In addition to fine-tuning capabilities, Windows AI Studio will also highlight state-of-the-art (SOTA) models optimized specifically for Windows GPUs and NPUs in the future, starting with Llama 2-7B, Mistral-7B, Falcon-7B, and Stable Diffusion XL. Earlier this year, we talked about how ONNX Runtime is the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/unlocking-the-end-to-end-windows-ai-developer-experience-using-onnx-runtime-and-olive/">gateway to Windows AI</a>. DirectML is the native Windows machine learning API, and together they give developers access to a simplified yet highly performant AI development experience. With <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models, developers can ensure that their models run as performantly as possible with the DirectML+ONNX Runtime combo.

At Inspire this year we shared details on how developers will be able to run Llama 2 with <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">DirectML and the ONNX Runtime</a> and we have been hard at work to make this a reality. We now have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">sample</a> showing our progress with Llama 2 7B; after an Olive optimization pass, our sample shows how developers can now run this versatile LLM locally and performantly on varied Windows hardware. We're excited about this milestone, and this is only a first peek. Stay tuned for future enhancements to support even larger models, fine-tuning and lower-precision data types.  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56883">Learn more.</a>

<strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) </strong>offers a robust platform for AI development on Windows by making it easy to run Windows and Linux workloads simultaneously. Developers can easily share files, GUI apps, GPU and more between environments with no additional setup. WSL is now enhanced to meet the enterprise grade security requirements so enterprise customers can confidently deploy WSL for their developers to take advantage of both Windows and Linux operating systems on the same Windows device and accelerate AI development efficiently.
<h3><strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux now offers new enterprise features that enhance security and simplify deployment </strong></h3>
It’s now easier than ever to securely deploy WSL to your company with the latest enterprise features. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint released a new plug-in for WSL that enables security teams to continuously monitor events in all running distributions – delivering unparalleled visibility into systems once considered a critical blind spot.</li>
 	<li>Access to WSL and its key security settings are now controllable with Intune. Admins can configure access to WSL entirely, or dive into access to specific security settings like custom kernel, nested virtualization and more, to ensure security while using WSL.</li>
 	<li>Advanced networking controls in WSL let you specify firewall rules that apply to the WSL virtual machine and improve network compatibility in complex enterprise environments. <a href="https://aka.ms/wslenterpriseblogpost">Learn more</a> to get started with WSL today!</li>
</ul>
We want to ensure Windows is optimized for developers and helps you be productive across any development you do – desktop, web, AI or cross-platform. That’s why we introduced Dev Home, your ultimate productivity companion, at Build 2023. Dev Home is a new experience for developers on Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools such as GitHub. Today, Dev Home is getting even better for you.
<h3><strong>Dev Home now has Azure DevOps extension so you can stay on top of your daily tasks</strong></h3>
We are thrilled to release Dev Home v0.7 with Azure DevOps (ADO) support powered by the new Dev Home Azure extension. This extension allows you to easily clone your Azure repositories using Dev Home to get your machine to a code-ready state, manage your ADO projects and get productive right away from the Windows desktop. Additionally, you can pin ADO widgets to display query results and query tiles to provide easily glanceable information for the projects you care about most. Enterprises can take advantage of Dev Home to onboard new team members and projects faster and developers can stay on top of projects, queries and relevant tasks from Dev Home.

With our focus on empowering every developer to be an AI developer and continued investments on developer productivity, we believe Windows now provides the best platform for you to jumpstart local AI development and create cutting edge experiences for your customers. We are humbled and excited to be on this journey with you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[At Inspire this year we <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/">talked</a> about how developers will be able to run Llama 2 on Windows with DirectML and the ONNX Runtime and we've been hard at work to make this a reality.

We now have a sample showing our progress with Llama 2 7B!

See <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2">https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/llama_v2</a>

This sample relies on first doing an optimization pass on the model with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main">Olive</a>, a powerful optimization tool for ONNX models. Olive utilizes powerful graph fusion optimizations from ONNX Runtime and a model architecture optimized for DirectML to speed up inference times by up to <strong>10X</strong>!

After this optimization pass, Llama 2 7B runs fast enough that you can have a conversation in real time on multiple vendors’ hardware!

We’ve also built a little UI to make it easy to see the optimized model in action.

Thank you to our hardware partners who helped make this happen. For more on how Llama 2 lights up on our partners’ hardware with DirectML see:

We are now pleased to share with you that features like Dev Home, Dev Drive, WinGet and improvements to Taskbar, File Explorer and many more will start to become generally available with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178424">latest Windows 11 update</a>. We also have exciting news to share about the developer tools you already know and love: Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Terminal.

At Build in May ’23, we announced a new home for developers on Windows – Dev Home. With the latest Windows 11 update, Dev Home is now available as part of the OS, making developer features a key component of Windows 11. Today we are excited to announce a new PC setup experience for developers.
<h3><strong>A new PC setup experience for developers on Windows 11</strong></h3>
For the first time in Windows, you will be able to identify as a developer during your initial PC setup and Windows will customize your install experience catering to your workloads. To do this, select the "Development" intent on the "Let's customize your experience" page during setup. Once you set up your PC with “Development” intent it is easier to get all the benefits of Dev Home.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56856 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Developer-Intent_hi-res-1024x576.png" alt="Development intent screen" width="1024" height="576" />
<h3><strong>Dev Home: Your productivity companion</strong></h3>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home</a> is a new experience for developers in Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages, or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools (such as GitHub). It also helps you create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/">Dev Drive</a> for performant storage - all in one place. Dev Home also provides a customizable dashboard to help you monitor both your system and dev projects. We are releasing Dev Home v0.5 alongside the latest Windows 11 update to provide even more functionality like managing your extensions. We are adding a new extensions page on Dev Home, available now, that helps you discover and manage your Dev Home extensions, giving you the control to enhance and personalize your experience. With this addition, the Dev Home GitHub Extension will no longer be automatically installed. For more information see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home for Windows Developers | Microsoft Learn.</a>
<h3><strong>Unattended and reliable dev machine setup: Reducing set up time from days to hours</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced WinGet Configuration, a fast and reliable mechanism to help developers get ready to code in just a few clicks. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/configuration/">WinGet Configuration</a> is now stable and no longer requires enabling experimental features. To help you get started we have several <a href="https://aka.ms/dsc.yaml">samples</a> that you can try, and several GitHub repos now include configuration files to help you quickly install the tools to build the source code.  For example:

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">vscode/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/vscode (github.com)</a>

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">PowerToys/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/PowerToys (github.com)</a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56854 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Configure.jpg" alt="WinGet Configuration code" width="994" height="562" />

WinGet 1.6 makes its debut with several exciting new capabilities. Support for dependencies is now available. Packages that were previously blocked from submission can now be added to our catalog.

WinGet 1.6 introduces the new `winget download` command which allows you to download installers. This feature enables IT professionals to access packages from the community repository and make them available to their enterprise customers.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56855 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Download.jpg" alt="WinGet download code" width="994" height="562" />

Support for free Apps rated “e” for everyone from the Microsoft Store with licenses is coming in a future release.

A new Group Policy enables IT professionals to determine if their users can make use of the Windows Package Manager through either the CLI or PowerShell cmdlets. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases">The latest release of the WinGetCLI</a> contains the updated ADMX files. For more information on using winget, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">Use the winget tool to install and manage applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.
<h3><strong>Dev Drive: A new storage volume tailor-made for developers: supercharged for performance and security</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced Dev Drive – a new type of storage volume, tailor-made for developers, with a file system that delivers both performance and security. Starting today, Dev Drive will be available for all developers on Windows with the latest Windows 11 update.

Dev Drive is based on the Resilient File System (ReFS), which, combined with a new performance mode capability in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus, offers up to 30% file system improvement in build times for file I/O scenarios. To reap the benefits of Dev Drive, we recommend moving your package caches and repositories to Dev Drive(s). <a href="https://aka.ms/devdrive">Learn more</a>.

In addition, to quickly view the status of your Dev Drive volumes, the “For Developers settings page” now has a new Dev Drive section. The section also provides deep links to Disk &amp; Volume settings to create a Dev Drive and launch the Windows Security app to control antivirus behavior.
<h3><strong>Performance mode for Microsoft Defender </strong></h3>
Microsoft Defender Antivirus has released performance mode that provides asynchronous scanning on Dev Drive volumes. Behavior can be controlled via the new improved UI for Dev Drive <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">  </span> in the Microsoft Security app under “Virus &amp; threat protection”. If you have multiple Dev Drives, you can now quickly identify which one is in “Performance mode”.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56849 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_02-1024x900.png" alt="Virus and threat protection settings" width="1024" height="900" />

Upon clicking on “See volumes”, you can view all your Dev Drives. In this example below, we have two Dev Drives; (D:\) and (F:\) are both formatted in ReFS but Defender Performance Mode has been enabled only on (F:\).

<strong> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-56848 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_03-1024x407.png" alt="Dev Drive protection screen" width="1024" height="407" /></strong>
<h3><strong>Reducing toil and unlocking the fun and joy of developing on Windows with new improvements</strong></h3>
The team has listened closely to what is top of mind for you, including improvements to the Taskbar that we announced at Build back in May. Starting today, all these improvements will become available in the stable version with the latest Windows 11 update.
<ol>
 	<li>You can now quickly identify and access any instance of each app housed in the taskbar with just one click. All instances of the app are ungrouped with labels on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can now hide your Time and Date with a setting on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can quickly and easily shut down applications with a simple right-click on the app directly from the taskbar without opening the Task Manager. This setting can be enabled within the Developer settings page to then have “End task” appear within the context menu when you right-click on the icon within taskbar.</li>
 	<li>For Developers settings page has moved from “Privacy &amp; Security” to System. This provides a quick and easily discoverable entry point to developer settings.</li>
 	<li>You can now get improved performance of archive functionality during compression on Windows. We have added native support for additional archive formats, including tar, 7-zip, rar, gz and many others using the libarchive open-source project.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>File Explorer is getting even better </strong></h3>
We have introduced new functionality and collection control in WinUI3. ItemsView collection control offers LinedFlowLayout and Island functionality provides an easy way to adopt WinUI3 look and feel in any part of your app without having to change your entire application. File Explorer now runs on WinUI3 and has introduced several new features like Gallery powered by ItemsView and Island functionality, making it easy to access your photo collection. You can also now bring these new WinUI3 capabilities to your apps and offer a rich user experience to your customers.

In addition, we have also added multi-threading capabilities to File Explorer to greatly improve the performance of copy, move, recycle, and delete actions. Large operations should see significant improvements in the calculating phase as well as the actual file operation. As noted in our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/26/delivering-delightful-performance-for-more-than-one-billion-users-worldwide/">May 2023 blog</a>, these changes show over 40% improvements in bulk delete operations, giving time back to developers.
<h2><strong>Tools you know and love are getting even better and smarter </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>New and exciting – Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input and Web Search features are coming to Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview</strong></h3>
With the Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview we are introducing several new features such as the Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input, and Web Search. The Suggestions UI is a new UI element in Windows Terminal that provides text suggestions to the user. These suggestions can come from recently run commands, saved commands, and more.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56853 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/SuggestionsUI.gif" alt="Suggestions user experience" width="994" height="589" />

Broadcast Input allows users to broadcast their input from one Terminal pane to another Terminal pane in real time. Broadcast Input was a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2634">popular feature request</a> from our community members, and we are thrilled to delight our developers with this exciting feature.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56851 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/BroadcastInput.gif" alt="Broadcast input experience" width="1338" height="717" />

Web Search was a community contribution. When the right-click context menu is enabled, users will have a new option to do a web search on highlighted text. Web Search will default to Bing, and we are providing control to developers to change the default to the search engine of their choice.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56852 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/WebSearch.gif" alt="Web Search user experience" width="1914" height="560" data-wp-editing="1" />
<h3><strong>Introducing experimental features in Windows Terminal Canary</strong></h3>
Windows Terminal is distributed in a variety of formats. We are thrilled to announce that we are adding Windows Terminal Canary to the Windows Terminal family. Windows Terminal Canary is a new canary build of Windows Terminal that includes “hot off the presses” experimental features (including our AI chat feature).

New builds of Windows Terminal Canary are available nightly. This is the least stable channel of Windows Terminal, so you may be the first to discover bugs that no one else has before. If you are eager for the latest bits, then this is the build for you!
<h3><strong>New experimental features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - Auto Memory reclaim, new networking mode and more</strong></h3>
The <a href="http://www.github.com/microsoft/wsl/releases">latest release of WSL</a> brings access to new experimental features and some important quality and bug fixes! We’ve added new experimental features that you <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">can opt-in to using</a>, so you can get early access to WSL improvements that we are investigating making default in the future. This includes having the WSL VM automatically shrink in memory size when you’re not using it, setting your WSL virtual hard disks to be sparse so they will automatically shrink in disk size and conserve your disk space, as well as Hyper-V firewall which allows your Windows firewall rules to affect your WSL distros, and an entirely new networking mode that improves network compatibility, adds IPv6 support and more! Additionally, there are other bug fixes such as you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/9231">now run WSL in session 0,</a> WSL GUI apps have Windows snapping support with the keyboard, and more! To see a full list of WSL changes please <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">see this blog post</a>.

We continue to invest in driving developer productivity, convenience and performance with every update, and we are excited to share these features and experiences with you.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Windows PCs require a restart to apply each month’s security updates. Today we’re offering tips and best practices that can help you make sure your applications seamlessly resume after a restart and keep your app users happy.

Some users manage Windows updates (and restarts) for themselves. Others prefer that their PCs automatically restart when not in use. In either case, users typically prefer to find their applications exactly as they left them after an update. Their flow on Windows is more productive and fun when apps restore their state, position and pending operations following an update.

What does this mean for you as an application developer? If your app is documentation-focused, you might want to help people remember where in the document they were editing most recently. If your app helps people modify images, consider saving their “undo” stack and/or creating a temporary copy of their workspace. For game developers, it might be helpful to implement a quick “save” and ask players where they would like to resume. Ultimately, your apps can offer seamless continuity following a restart – for updates or otherwise – by following a few best practices:
<ul>
 	<li>Save the user’s state.</li>
 	<li>Remember how their previous views were positioned.</li>
 	<li>Relaunch the app following the update.</li>
</ul>
In this post, we will explore native APIs you can use to help you save an app user’s work and resume an app state following a restart.
<h2>Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps</h2>
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) provides <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle">lifecycle management capabilities</a> to applications. While a UWP app doesn’t need anything special to be restarted and resumed after a system update, it is recommended to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle#save-your-state">save the app state<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span></a> periodically.
<h2>Win32 apps</h2>
If you are developing a Windows desktop app, you can use the Application Recovery and Restart (ARR) APIs to register your app for restart. Specifically, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">registering for restart</a> helps applications cleanly close upon system restart and relaunch after restart with pre-defined arguments.

Whether you are building Win32 apps or you’re using Windows app SDK, you can find <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cpp-winui-packaged">ARR API usage samples on GitHub</a>.

In addition to registering apps for restart, you should consider how an app can best resume its previous workload and recover the previous state. Common strategies include saving often to disk and providing context to resume state in the arguments used when registering via ARR API. Here is a code example:
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">// Register for restart with the current value of app text box

RegisterApplicationRestart(counterTextBlock().Text().c_str(), 0);

// Update registration before crash with the new value of the app counter text box

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK([](PVOID recoveryData){


     BOOL canceled;

     if (SUCCEEDED(ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(&amp;canceled)) &amp;&amp; !canceled)

     {

          const auto counter = static_cast&lt;uint32_t*&gt;(recoveryData);

          RegisterApplicationRestart(to_hstring(*counter).c_str(), 0);
     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return (DWORD)0;

     }), &amp;_counter, RECOVERY_DEFAULT_PING_INTERVAL, 0);</pre>
<h2>.NET apps</h2>
Similar to Win32 apps, .NET apps can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">register</a> for restart by using the ARR APIs. The only difference is using <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32">p/Invoke</a> to wrap the native API calls. You can find .NET sample code using ARR APIs <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cs-winui-packaged">on GitHub</a>.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

// Best effort to register recovery callback to update restart arguments with the latest seconds counter value.

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(new APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK(p =&gt;

{

     ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(out BOOL canceled);

     if (!canceled)

     {

          RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return 0;

}), null, 5000, 0);</pre>
Apps with critical workloads can use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate">power APIs</a> to keep the system running and prevent a restart, but this isn’t permanent. Both users and administrators need devices to stay secure and a system will eventually be forced to restart after an update. Further, keeping the system powered on can drain battery or use excess power.

We encourage you to read more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate#remarks">how to effectively use Power APIs</a> for system services and long-running critical applications.
<h2>Share your feedback</h2>
Have suggestions or ideas for API improvement? Still have questions about how your app and Windows Update can work together? Please share your thoughts by submitting them via Feedback Hub (Windows key + F)!
