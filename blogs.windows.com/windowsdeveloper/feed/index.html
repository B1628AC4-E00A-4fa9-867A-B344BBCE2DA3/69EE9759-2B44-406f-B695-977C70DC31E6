										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56197" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/H2Q4w9xg_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />Daniel Paulino created his first Windows app when he was at a career crossroads: Was he good enough to have a successful career as a developer? He wasn’t sure, but Daniel also knew he needed a timer app that connected to his workout band. “At the time, no app did this. I had this curiosity. That drove me back into building apps,” Daniel says.

Daniel’s curiosity has served him well. Today, he is the creator of multiple Windows apps, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pillbox/9nblggh4x7vb">Pillbox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nightingale-rest-client/9n2t6f9f5zdn">Nightingale</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ambie-white-noise/9p07xnm5chp0">Ambie</a>. He is also a software engineer on the Windows apps team — and it’s safe to say Daniel is a Microsoft devices and tooling fanatic. “I’ve been around the block, but I keep coming back to Visual Studio, .NET, and WinUI. I’m addicted to Microsoft’s advanced set of tooling. It empowers me to take what’s in my brain and put it into an app.”

Looking at the many apps Daniel has released in the last five years, it would be easy to conclude his career path was straightforward — but from Daniel’s perspective, becoming a developer was more indirect: It came from following his passions.
<h3><strong>From a hobby to a career</strong></h3>
He was well into university before he considered software development as a career. Growing up, Daniel spent a lot of time in hospitals, watching doctors investigate both he and his mother’s medical issues. He became fascinated by the doctors’ curiosity and how they worked from interrogation and discovery to understand the root causes of disease.

This interest made Daniel plan to study Molecular Biology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver — until he had to take a course in Python. Daniel had always been drawn to computers, even though his family could not afford to buy a new one. Out of necessity, Daniel became the family expert at optimizing the operating system — he had even cleaned up the Windows OS registry on an old PC until it ran as well as the new devices his friends had.

Despite his passion for technology, Daniel never believed that his hobby could become a career — until that Python course, and after a guest speaker at his university asked him if he had ever heard of Bioinformatics. That moment changed the rest of his career: Daniel’s school offered a joint major program that fused his passions for medicine and immunology and his growing love for computer science. This discovery opened a new world.
<h3>Real-world problem solving</h3>
Looking back at his school experiences, Daniel is quick to recommend new developers build tools that solve real-world problems. He had a revelatory moment at his first bioinformatics job when his boss suggested that Daniel build the first-ever C++ tool that efficiently closed gaps in the human genome. The experience left an indelible mark: he was struck by how impactful his work could be.

Following this experience, Daniel applied and was accepted to a software engineering internship at Microsoft Garage. It was his first role exclusively as a developer. He and the four other interns on his team had four months to build their product, a Windows Phone app, from start to finish. While he learned a lot about collaboration, Daniel’s biggest takeaway was how much he needed to grow. Daniel recalls, “It was a very humbling experience. I wasn’t good enough at the time and that was hard to accept.” Daniel even considered removing computer science from his degree.

While he felt uncertain about what direction to take, Daniel turned to developing apps to solve real problems. “It was this passion and curiosity that reignited my interest in software. I didn’t actively stop myself from quitting, but I let myself be curious.”

<h3><strong>Empowering people with apps</strong></h3>
Daniel’s proudest achievement came from one of the apps he built during this time, Pillbox. The app tracks a user’s medication schedule and reminds users when to take their pills. He built it to help his mother keep track of her wide variety of medications.

His mother’s real-world challenge proved to be the perfect place for Daniel to put his app development skills to work. He was eager to help his mother and excited to learn about databases and notifications — two integral pieces of the app. Daniel’s mother also acted as his stakeholder, helping him make the app easier to use when she requested new features.

Developing Pillbox shaped how Daniel thinks about development: Not only had he learned how to work with a stakeholder, but he also got to see the impact the technology had on his mother. Even though she was far from a tech enthusiast, she could load all her information in the app, keep it up to date and easily share her information with her doctor.

What stuck with Daniel the most was how he was able to empower his mother. He says a defining moment came when “One day we went to the ER and the nurse asked if my mom took any medicines. When she showed them the app, the nurse was so excited and asked where she got it. My mom was able to say, ‘My son made it for me.’”

Daniel recommends this kind of real-world problem-solving. “Be curious. Build software that empowers people. That will teach you a lot about yourself.”
<h3><strong>Pursuing growth opportunities</strong></h3>
Daniel continued to develop Windows apps after he graduated from university — while also starting a full-time job building bioinformatics tools. His development skills and enthusiasm for software development grew faster than ever, thanks to this cycle of developing both at work and home. Eventually, he hit a learning ceiling and Daniel realized that he needed to focus exclusively on development as a career.

<img class="alignleft wp-image-56200 size-medium" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/04/1585425084522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />For anyone looking to make a similar switch, Daniel says, “Keep in touch with your network. In the long run, this can open up new opportunities when it’s time. Just learning from your network also helps you grow.”

Ultimately, Daniel ended up working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. While many of his friends assumed that working at Microsoft would be the end of his development efforts after hours, becoming a full-time developer made Daniel even more excited about development. “I continued coding on the bus and the train. The process of coding at work — and then coding at home — doubled my learning speed,” Daniel says. The skills he was learning at work made the apps he developed at home much better. In turn, that practice made him better at work.
<h3><strong>Following his curiosity today</strong></h3>
Throughout his career, Daniel keeps coming back to empowering others. “When I discovered software, I realized I was creative. My outlet was code,” he says. Once he had this outlet, he wanted to use it to help other people.

Amid the pandemic, Daniel created Ambie, a white noise app designed to help you focus, sleep or meditate. “What drives me is channeling my creativity to help someone, whether that’s to get something done with Nightingale or help them improve their health,” Daniel says.

“Developers have a unique opportunity to build something in their apartment that can affect a lot of people around the world. I just want to keep growing and helping more and more people that way.”]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">After many months of invigorating the Windows Community Toolkit with a multitude of improvements and features; we are happy to announce version 7.0 is available today! Made possible again with the support and contributions of our developer community</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">🎉</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you are new to the Toolkit, the Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helpers, extensions, and custom controls. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks for building UWP and .NET apps for Windows 10. The toolkit is part of the .NET Foundation. You can </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp"><span data-contrast="none">download our Sample App</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> playground to discover and try Toolkit components before getting started on a project</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This new update includes a whole new .NET Standard MVVM library, easier to use Toast Notification helpers for both .NET and UWP, a completely revamped composition Animation system for C# &amp; XAML, new controls, and more!</span><span data-contrast="auto">!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This is one of the largest releases of the Toolkit ever as we embarked to optimize and streamline the Toolkit for the future. However, it also contains many breaking changes to pay attention to both around its underlying structure and code contracts. Please be sure to read </span><a href="https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/releases/tag/v7.0.0"><span data-contrast="none">our release notes here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, some high-level overviews are provided below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">There should be something for everyone in this release as it includes a wide variety of features; we hope you will enjoy them for building .NET and UWP apps on Windows 10.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The package targets .NET Standard so it can be used on any app platform: UWP, WPF, Xamarin, </span><a href="https://platform.uno/"><span data-contrast="none">Uno Platform</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and more; and on any runtime: .NET Native, .NET Core, .NET Framework, or Mono.

<span data-contrast="auto">This makes it much easier to abstract the base Model and ViewModel logic from the application later, especially for projects which may want to target multiple UI frameworks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">This new library has been a nearly year-long community effort driven by </span><a href="https://github.com/Sergio0694"><span data-contrast="none">Sergio Pedri</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and inspired by the work done by </span><a href="https://lbugnion.me/"><span data-contrast="none">Laurent Bugnion</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">’s MVVM Light. The </span><a href="https://aka.ms/wts"><span data-contrast="none">Windows Template Studio</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> team is also bringing support for the library to their suite of design patterns. We have worked with them, Microsoft MVPs (Matt Lacey, James Croft, Nick Randolph, Diederik Krols, and Martin Zikmund), and our community to develop, test, and validate core scenarios of the library before its release here. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In every one of the billion Windows 10 devices worldwide, there is a GPU for accelerating your AI tasks. From photo editing applications enabling new user experiences through AI to tools that help you train machine learning models for your applications with little effort, DirectML accelerates these experiences by leveraging the computing power of any DirectX 12 GPU. Over a hundred applications already take advantage of DirectML—with over two hundred million hardware accelerated inferences performed daily on Windows. To make it even easier for applications to take advantage of DirectML, we are excited to announce the public release of DirectML as a standalone API for Win32, UWP, and WSL applications in a single NuGet package, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/">Microsoft.AI.DirectML</a>. Let's look at a few ways DirectML is used today and spark ideas for your own applications.

Healthcare is another field leveraging machine learning techniques in interesting ways. Consider a sonographer using an ultrasound device to evaluate fetal brain development during their patient’s pregnancy. Acquiring the required planes and taking the required measurements for this is challenging because it requires lots of manual input from the sonographer. This is where GE Healthcare’s Voluson™ Ultrasound Devices comes in handy: pre-trained neural networks help the sonographer using the ultrasound probe automatically segment specific imaging planes from a volume and perform manual measurements. Previously identifying the approriate planes and measurements required time consuming manual adjustments. GE Healthcare relies on Windows ML and DirectML for delivering consistent and reliable results across a broad range of their ultrasound devices.

An exciting area of growth is at the intersection of machine learning and real-time graphics in video games where performance is critical. Early applications in this area include using neural networks for superior image upscaling and filling in the sampling gaps of ray-traced images; these techniques are making it possible to present high-resolution gameplay without the cost of high-resolution rendering. The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectMLSuperResolution">DirectML Super Resolution sample</a> showcases how DirectML can integrate seamlessly with these real-time graphics intensive applications.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and new applications like these are introduced every day: models are used for transcribing audio, translating hand-written notes into text, fault detection in manufacturing, and many more! DirectML has provided the hardware acceleration support needed for these scenarios since Windows 10 version 1903. Now the DirectML NuGet package offers our latest hardware acceleration investments even sooner to framework and application developers. If your model is representable using the ONNX format, then you too can tap into DirectML.
<h2>Training Models with TensorFlow and Lobe</h2>
Accelerating inference is where DirectML started: supporting training workloads across the breadth of GPUs in the Windows ecosystem is the next step. In September 2020, we <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/09/08/open-sourcing-tensorflow-with-directml/">open sourced TensorFlow with DirectML</a> to bring cross-vendor acceleration to the popular TensorFlow framework. This project is all about enabling rapid experimentation and training on your PC, regardless of which GPU you have on your device, with a simple and painless setup process. We also know many machine learning developers depend on tools, libraries, and containerized workloads that only work with Unix-like operating systems, so DirectML runs in both Windows <em>and</em> the Windows Subsystem for Linux. DirectML makes it easy for you to work with the environment and GPU you already have.

Machine learning is also becoming increasingly accessible with tools like <a href="https://www.lobe.ai/">Lobe</a> – an easy to use app that has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. To get started, collect and label your images and Lobe will automatically train a custom machine learning model for you. On Windows, Lobe uses DirectML to deliver great performance across a wide range of GPUs. When training is done, you can try out your model and ship it to any platform you choose.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
Win32 APIs provide powerful functionality that let you get the most out of Windows in your applications. While these APIs are readily accessible to C and C++ developers, other languages like C# and Rust require wrappers or bindings in order to access these APIs. In C#, this is commonly known as platform invoking or P/Invoke.

Historically this has required developers to handcraft the wrappers or bindings, which is error prone and doesn’t scale to broad API coverage. In recent years, given the strong demand for calling Win32 APIs from various languages, several community projects have spawned to provide more strongly typed and idiomatic representations of these wrappers and bindings to provide an improved developer experience and spare developers the overhead of creating them themselves. Some notable projects include <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span></a> for .NET and <a href="https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winapi-rs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Rust</span>.

The main challenge with these projects is they are manually maintained, which makes broad and sustained API coverage difficult and costly, and their work doesn’t really benefit other languages.

As owners of the Windows SDK, we wanted to see where we could provide unique value here, take some of the burden off of the community, and make achieving broad and sustainable API coverage across languages a reality.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of this is our </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project and corresponding Win32 language projections now in preview on GitHub!</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Win32 Metadata</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project is to provide a complete description of the Win32 API surface in metadata so that it can be projected to any language in an automated way, improving correctness and minimizing maintenance overhead. The output of this project is effectively an ECMA-335 compliant Windows metadata file (winmd) published to Nuget.org containing metadata describing the entire Win32 API surface.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Win32 APIs have existed for a long time, so accurately describing all of them will take some iteration. We will be developing this tooling in the open and welcome community contributions to ensure an accurate representation of the Win32 API surface that will benefit all languages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this metadata to enable developers to call Win32 APIs idiomatically from the language of their choice, we need language projections built on top of it. The first such language projection is </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Built in partnership with Andrew Arnott, the owner of the </span><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project for .NET, </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parses the metadata and generates the P/Invoke wrappers required to call the APIs you care about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply add a reference to the Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32 package from NuGet.org and add a file called NativeMethods.txt to the root of your project with a list of Win32 functions you want to call. The file can contain one function per line or even wildcards like BCrypt.* for including entire modules. Once populated, </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will generate the P/Invoke wrappers for the functions you request and all of their dependencies.</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56107 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/01/CsWin32.gif" alt="" width="1572" height="925" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see in the animation above, after adding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CreateFile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to NativeMethods.txt and a using statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft.Windows.Sdk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> namespace, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CreateFile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be called via the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> static class. </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides rich Intellisense, strong types for parameters, and also includes the relevant documentation from </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">docs.microsoft.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all dynamically generated from metadata based on the APIs you request! No additional dependencies are required, broad API coverage is achieved with improved correctness and minimal maintenance overhead, and the APIs are expressed idiomatically as C# developers would expect.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn more about </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and try it for yourself by visiting the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just an early example of what’s possible with dynamically created projections of Win32 APIs. We envision projections like this for many languages, all expressing Win32 APIs in whatever idiomatic patterns developers of the language expect. The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rust crate is another example.</span><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust language projection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follows in the tradition established by </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++/WinRT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of building language projections for Windows using standard languages and compilers, providing a natural and idiomatic way for Rust developers to call Windows APIs. The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate lets you call any Windows API using code generated on the fly directly from the metadata, enabling you to call the APIs as if they were just another Rust module. It does not attempt to partition Windows APIs by technology, instead providing a single way to call any Windows API regardless of the underlying technology. You can seamlessly make use of APIs based on C-style exports, COM interfaces, or WinRT types. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Languages</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are also working on a </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cppwin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern C++</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projection in the open on GitHub and welcome community contributions there. These projects are early previews and under active development so are subject to change significantly as we absorb feedback and make progress. We will work with the community to support other languages based on </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partnering with existing community projects where appropriate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the umbrella of the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, we hope to advocate a set of </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/docs/projections.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">principles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all language projections should follow for the best developer experience while providing flexibility for each projection to do what’s best for their community.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Win32 APIs more accessible to more languages will allow developers to make the most out of Windows regardless of their preferred language. We are excited to engage with the community to expand API coverage and language support and minimize the maintenance overhead of existing projects.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you tuned in to this morning’s App Development Community Standup, you know that today we released WinUI 3 Preview 3. If you want to skip the summary and head straight to the release notes and installation instructions, <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/preview3">you can find those here</a>.
<h2>New Features</h2>
The team has been hard at work on Preview 3 since the release of Preview 2 back in July. Countless bug fixes, exciting new capabilities, and improvements on existing capabilities will hopefully make this a great Preview for you all to try out. Here are some highlights from Preview 3 that are new since Preview 2:
<ul>
 	<li>ARM64 Support</li>
 	<li>Drag and drop inside and outside of apps</li>
 	<li>RenderTargetBitmap (only XAML content for now – SwapChainPanel content will be captured later)</li>
 	<li>Improvements to our tooling/developer experience:
<ul>
 	<li>Live Visual Tree, Hot Reload, Live Property Explorer and similar tools</li>
 	<li>Intellisense now working for WinUI 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/blob/main/dev/MRTCore/README.md">MRT Core Integration</a> – making apps faster and lighter on startup and providing quicker resource lookup</li>
 	<li>Custom cursor support</li>
 	<li>Off-thread input APIs</li>
</ul>
These changes continue to advance the capabilities of WinUI 3 for supporting heavy-duty, complex apps.  Your feedback has been vital to the advancement of this platform, so please keep that coming!  Let us know if you encounter bugs, what you wish worked differently, and what you’d like to see in the future by opening an issue on our <a href="https://aka.ms/winui/github">GitHub repo</a>. I’m also looking forward to hearing all of your questions about Preview 3 on our upcoming December Community Call, which will be held on 12/16.

Since this is a preview release, the usual caveats apply: you may still encounter some bumps in the road while using it. Please refer to the <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/preview3#known-issues-and-limitations">list of known issues and limitations</a> for tips.
<h2>Using WinUI 3 Preview 3</h2>
Preview 3 has a similar installation and setup process to Preview 2, but requires an updated version of Visual Studio (16.9), which will automatically download the latest .NET 5 for you as well, if you are interested in building Desktop apps. There are also a few sample apps you can look through: the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/#xaml-controls-gallery-winui-3-preview-3-branch">WinUI 3 version of the XAML Controls Gallery</a> where you can interact directly with all of the included controls, as well as the sample apps that you may have seen demo’ed at Build or Ignite – they’ve been updated to use Preview 3, and you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-3-Demos">find them here</a>.

We recommend creating <em>new</em> projects when using WinUI 3 Preview 3. The process of upgrading an app from Preview 2 to Preview 3 can quickly become tricky and complicated. However, if you’ve been working hard on a large-scale app with Preview 2 and don’t want to create new project files, we do have <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/upgrade-instructions">a list of upgrade steps</a> that you can use as guidance.
<h2>What’s Next</h2>
Updates on post-Preview 3 planning and features will be posted on our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#winui-30-feature-roadmap">WinUI 3 feature roadmap</a>. Until then, you can always stay up-to-date with the WinUI team on <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml">GitHub</a>. Thanks for trying out Preview 3 and supporting WinUI – can’t wait to hear what you all think!
