										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Client apps are often the first interaction users have with your services, whether those are cloud native intelligent apps, web-hosted backends or business data. They set the tone for user experience and can offer personalized interactions right from the start. With over 1.5 billion Windows devices worldwide, you have an opportunity to build beautiful, responsive and engaging user experiences that target these devices.

Regardless of whether you are a web developer or a native app developer, you likely want to reach the most client devices possible with great user experiences in the most efficient way possible. Developing great client apps helps you connect with users, scale your services and keep users coming back. To help you achieve these goals, Microsoft invests in a wide variety of client application frameworks and technologies for developers to build custom client experiences.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57152 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/clientinvestments1920-1024x517.png" alt="Chart showing Microsoft investments in client development" width="1024" height="517" />Microsoft is actively investing across all these areas for client development, which includes multiple technologies for building Windows native, Cross-platform, Hybrid and Web client apps. This post outlines the native client application frameworks for Windows that we are investing in and features some of the incredible work we’ve been doing in those areas.
<h1>WinUI</h1>
WinUI, along with the two WinUI-based cross platform frameworks React Native for Desktop and .NET MAUI, are the three technologies we recommend for developing new applications that truly align with the Windows native experience.

WinUI enables developers to create fast and polished apps with the same rich set of modern UI controls and styles that powers key experiences in Windows. Its powerful toolkit has been refined in the most recent Windows App SDK 1.6 release, offering developers new performance improvements and control updates.

In WinAppSDK 1.6, WinUI adds Native Ahead-of-Time compilation support, one of the major new features in .NET development that results in apps with significantly reduced startup times and memory footprints.

In addition, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.tabview?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">TabView</a> control now features a new tab tear-out mode that lets users drag tabs out of a WinUI app just like they do in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, creating a new window and enabling snapping or maximizing in one smooth motion as they drag. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.pipspager?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">PipsPager</a> control also received a new wrapping mode, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.ratingcontrol?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6">RatingControl</a> is now more customizable through theme resources.

You can also try the always up-to-date <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p3jfpwwdzrc?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">WinUI Gallery</a> app that showcases all the controls and styles available to make a WinUI 3 app with the Windows App SDK (source code available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery">https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery</a>).

[caption id="attachment_57153" align="aligncenter" width="1008"]<img class="wp-image-57153 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Picture4.png" alt="The WinUI 3 Gallery app showcased in dark mode" width="1008" height="690" /> The WinUI 3 Gallery app showcased in dark mode[/caption]

As a sneak peek for what’s coming to WinUI in the upcoming Windows App SDK 1.7-experimental1 release, developers can look forward to the reintroduction of the highly anticipated TitleBar control with a fresh set of community-driven feedback improvements, as well as windowing enhancements and convenience APIs for controlling window size, remembering position and more.
<h1>React Native for Desktop</h1>
React Native lets you use your React and JavaScript skills and tools to create native applications that target iOS, Android, Windows (via WinAppSDK and WinUI), macOS, TVs and more. Over the last several years, Meta has been working towards enabling the “<a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here">new architecture</a>” which includes new capabilities such as synchronous layout and effects, the concurrent renderer and better JS to native interfacing. At Microsoft, we’ve partnered with Meta to bring the new architecture to Windows and macOS.

In <a href="https://aka.ms/reactnative">React Native for Desktop version 0.76</a> (Fall 2024), new apps can optionally <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-new-arch">opt into the new architecture</a> preview when creating new apps from the CLI. On Windows, the new architecture unlocks new capabilities like deep integration with the Windows App SDK (including the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/composition">Scene Graph</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/overview">Windows Copilot Library</a>), as well as support for Win32-based applications. v0.76 also provides a template for library authors to write modules that simultaneously target both the old and new architectures.

Although the new architecture <a href="https://aka.ms/rnw-roadmap">is still in preview</a>, several of our key apps are validating the updated React Native for Desktop platform and are beginning to flight experiences on top of the new architecture. If you’re interested in seeing the capabilities of React Native for Desktop, <a href="https://Aka.ms/reactnativegalleryapp">you can download the React Native Gallery from the Microsoft Store</a>.

[caption id="attachment_57154" align="aligncenter" width="975"]<img class="wp-image-57154 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Picture5.png" alt="React Native Gallery app" width="975" height="548" /> The React Native Gallery app includes samples of React Native components and modules that you can use in React Native for Windows apps.[/caption]

<h1><strong>WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)</strong></h1>
<strong>Modern Apps</strong>

As part of the ongoing modernization of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), applications built on WPF and running on Windows 10 or later can now take advantage of cutting-edge design elements and behaviors. Key enhancements include:
<ul>
 	<li>Support for light and dark themes</li>
 	<li>Rounded corners for controls</li>
 	<li>Compliance with Windows 11 design guidelines</li>
 	<li>Accent color support for controls</li>
</ul>
The introduction of the new Fluent theme delivers a fresh, modern Windows 11 aesthetic to WPF applications. With integrated Light/Dark mode and system accent color support, this update is set to enhance user engagement by giving WPF applications a contemporary, polished appearance.

First showcased at Build 2024, the Fluent theme is now generally available as part of the official .NET 9 release for Windows 10, Windows 11 and also Windows Server 2019.

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ndlx60wx4kq?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">WPF Gallery App</a> is a sample tool that demonstrates WPF controls and styles to a WPF application in .NET 9 and onwards. The source code for this app is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples">https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples</a>.

<h2><strong>Hyphen based ligature support in WPF</strong></h2>
Based on valuable feedback from the WPF community (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/109">Issue#109</a>), we’ve addressed a longstanding issue with hyphen-based ligatures not working in WPF. This improvement is aimed at enhancing the developer experience by ensuring better text rendering and more polished typography in WPF applications.

<em> </em>
<h1>WinForms (Windows Forms)</h1>
Windows Forms has long been a favorite technology for lightweight desktop applications built on Win32 APIs, particularly within the enterprise Line of Business space. Beloved for the ease of use, now the latest updates to WinForms allow developers to start leveraging modern technology in their existing applications. Over the course of .NET 9, WinForms has modernized thousands of lines of code to leverage modern C# capabilities. In response to operating system enhancements WinForms has added multi-select support for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.folderbrowserdialog?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">FolderBrowserDialog</a>, click-through capabilities to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.toolstrip?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">ToolStrip</a> control, and more than 100 new and updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">System.Drawing</a> APIs to leverage more GDI+ capabilities than before. In response to overwhelming demand, WinForms also added a Dark Mode detection feature (in experimental mode)!

For the first time, with .NET 9, developers are able to quickly and easily leverage the async capabilities of Windows and .NET. In this release, WinForms has introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.invokeasync?view=windowsdesktop-9.0">Control.InvokeAsync</a>. This new API allows WinForms applications to more easily leverage Web APIs, Semantic Kernel, AI and more! These enhancements ensure that WinForms remains a powerful and versatile tool for modern desktop application development, bridging the gap between legacy systems and the cutting-edge technology of today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Passkeys on Windows just got easier! As part of Microsoft’s vision for a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/04/how-microsoft-can-help-you-go-passwordless-this-world-password-day/">passwordless future</a> we are working to make passkeys on Windows simple and intuitive. Passkeys are safer and easier to use than passwords, which are vulnerable to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">phishing and data breaches</a>. That is why, in support of a passwordless future, we partnered in the FIDO alliance with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">other platforms</a> in supporting passkeys. As part of our cross-industry commitment, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/26/new-security-features-in-windows-11-protect-users-and-empower-it/">launched</a> new native support for cross-device authentication and an updated experience to help users along the journey from website to platform. Continuing that journey at Authenticate 2024 we are introducing the following, which will be available in our Windows Insider channels in the coming months:
<ol>
 	<li>A plug-in model for third-party passkey providers</li>
 	<li>Enhanced native UX for passkeys</li>
 	<li>A Microsoft synced passkey provider</li>
</ol>
First, we’re excited to announce API support for third-party passkey providers to plug into the Windows 11 platform! Microsoft is partnering closely with 1Password, Bitwarden and others on integrating this capability to provide users with seamless third-party passkey provider integration into Windows 11. You will be able to use the same passkey on Windows 11 that you’ve created on your mobile device, and together we can raise the bar on login security with passkeys. To learn more join us at the Windows Security sessions at Authenticate Oct. 14-16!

Next, when creating and using passkeys, Windows 11 now has a redesigned Windows Hello experience. As a user, you can navigate to a website that supports passkeys and get prompted to select how you want to save your passkeys.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57115 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/10/Latest-update-Windows-Authenticate-Blog-Choose-passkey-1024x713.png" alt="Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a pop-up prompting the user to choose how to save their passkeys, protected with Windows Hello, with ‘Save to your Microsoft account’ and ‘Save another way’ as options." width="1024" height="713" />

<em>Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a pop-up prompting the user to choose how to save their passkeys, protected with Windows Hello, with ‘Save to your Microsoft account’ and ‘Save another way’ as options.</em>

You will be asked to complete a one-time setup with your Microsoft account, and you will be prompted to save a recovery key that will be used to verify your identity and protect your passkeys through end-to-end encryption. You can then seamlessly authenticate using your preferred sign-in method (facial recognition, fingerprint or PIN), and save your passkey with Windows Hello.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57116 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/10/Windows-Authenticate-Blog-WH-face-ID.png" alt="Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a Windows Security pop-up and Windows Hello searching for Face ID to authenticate and save the passkey." width="624" height="435" />

<em>Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a Windows Security pop-up and Windows Hello searching for Face ID to authenticate and save the passkey.</em><span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);"> </span>

Once you have created a new passkey you can choose to save it with Windows Hello and sync it so that you can also use it on another Windows device! Just login to another Windows 11 device with your Microsoft account, complete a one-time setup, and use your synced passkeys across your Windows 11 PCs. You get a simple, seamless, login experience—all you need to do is authenticate with Windows Hello. Your passkeys are secured by end-to-end encryption and protected with the device’s TPM (Trusted Platform Module).

Microsoft is committed to making passkeys more readily available wherever you need them, with the experience, flexibility and durability that you expect when using Windows. We are excited to have you try out these new features soon!

Join us as we continue paving the way towards a passwordless future with Windows 11.
<h3>Explore the new Windows 11 security features</h3>
At Microsoft, we truly believe that security is a team sport. By partnering with OEMs, app developers and other partners in the ecosystem, and by helping people be better at protecting themselves—we are continuing to make Windows more secure by design and more secure by default. The <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMyFE">Windows Security Book</a> is available to help you learn more about what makes it easy to stay secure with Windows 11.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">We are proud to announce that version 1.6 of the Windows App SDK is now available! Whether you’re looking for the incredible performance boost and footprint reduction of Native AOT support, enhancements for deploying your package, or quality of life improvements for controls like PipsPager and RatingControl, WinAppSDK 1.6 offers a raft of new features, performance boosts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and structural changes that enable you to make your native Windows apps better than ever before.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The Windows App SDK provides </span><span data-contrast="auto">a rich set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful and fast Windows desktop apps, including any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app. You can harness the modern controls and polish of WinUI 3, which ships as part of the WinAppSDK, or if you have an existing app that uses Win32 such as WPF, you can take advantage of only the parts of the SDK that you need. The WinAppSDK also stays up to date with frequent and OS-independent releases so your app can always access the latest innovations.</span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Get started with the Windows App SDK</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Check out the Windows App SDK </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span data-contrast="none">overview</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> page to learn more about it and see how to get started. Then, if you’re ready to dive into Visual Studio and begin with your first WinUI 3 app, see our </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10"><span data-contrast="none">setup instructions</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to start developing Windows apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">New features and improvements</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT support</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">With 1.6, the Windows App SDK now supports native Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation! When publishing your app as a Native AOT app, you produce an app which has been compiled ahead of time to native code for faster startup time and a smaller memory footprint.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We’re very excited to bring the powerful capabilities of Native AOT to developers through the Windows App SDK! In our sample Contoso Camera app, we measured a 50% reduction in start time, an ~8x reduction in package size when using a framework package</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and a ~2x reduction in package size when using Windows App SDK in self-contained mode. While your results might vary, we encourage you to give Native AOT a try if it’s right for your app! </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57148 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/11/Native-AOT-GIF-800-wide-1-loop.gif" alt="GIF of Bloom screensaver moving" width="800" height="291" />

<span data-contrast="auto">For more information about Native AOT, see </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT deployment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. To get started with Native AOT in your Windows App SDK app, see our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.6/1.6.0/release-notes"><span data-contrast="none">release notes for 1.6</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for what you need to know and how to set it up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Decoupled WebView2 versioning</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Instead of embedding a hard-coded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK into the Windows App SDK, we now consume the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference in 1.6. If your app uses WebView2 to display content, you can now choose a newer version of the Microsoft.Web.WebView2 package if you need to instead of the version that came with the Windows App SDK. Additionally, you can now reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK, streamlining your dependencies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">With these updates, we’ve decoupled the WinAppSDK from the Edge WebView2 API surface and brought NuGet’s sophisticated package management capabilities to the WebView2 space. Your WebView2-powered app experiences are now more versatile than ever and can tap into the newest WebView2 offerings at any time!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">New Package Deployment APIs</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Flexible and robust package management has been a mainstay of the Windows App SDK since its inception, and with the release of 1.6 we’re only making it better. We’ve improved package management APIs with new enhancements and quality-of-life updates including package removal, provisioning and detection of pending registration and locally available updates, easy feature availability detection for light-up scenarios and more. If your app uses MSIX packaging, these enhancements are tailored to make your life easier! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">For more details, you can peruse the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453"><span data-contrast="none">pull request here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or take a peek at </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md"><span data-contrast="none">the full spec</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> here.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Improved TabView tab tear-out</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">The WinUI 3 TabView control has received a substantial update to the tab tear-out experience in 1.6 in the form of a new CanTearOutTabs mode, overhauling how a user drags tabs out of your app in a major way. In the new mode, dragging a tab out of your app’s TabView is very similar to the tab drag experience in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome where a new window is immediately created during the drag. This allows users to visually see feedback of their action right away and it lets them drag the new window to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap it in one continuous motion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you enable the new CanTearOutTabs mode in your TabView, you won’t have to worry about any drag-and-drop API limitations because it doesn’t use them. And, you won’t have to worry about whether tearing tabs out of your app will work if the app is run as an Administrator, because that’s supported.

<h2>Getting started with DirectML on Copilot+ PCs</h2>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
Ensure you have the correct versions of DirectML, ONNX Runtime (ORT), Windows and the minimum versioned Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU driver.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML">DirectML minimum version of 1.15.4 or greater (ARM64)  </a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML/1.18">ONNX Runtime minimum version of 1.18 (ARM64) </a></li>
 	<li>Windows 11, version 24H2 or newer</li>
 	<li>Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU Driver minimum version 1.0.0.10</li>
</ul>
<h3>Developer-Environment Set-up on Your Copilot+ PC</h3>
Let’s walk through how you can utilize DirectML and ONNX Runtime to leverage a set of models on the Copilot+ PC powered by Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU. First, you need to ensure you have the latest Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU driver package. Setting up a Qualcomm dev account is your very first step:
<ol>
 	<li>Create an account at <a href="https://qpm.qualcomm.com/">https://qpm.qualcomm.com/</a></li>
</ol>
Now, log in with your account credentials and click the following link: <a href="https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/QHND">Qualcomm Package Manager 3</a> and download the <strong>latest driver</strong> available. Then, follow the steps below to download the Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU Driver Package for Windows:
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Change OS from "Windows" to "Windows (ARM64)"</li>
 	<li>Click Download (<strong>latest driver version available</strong>)</li>
 	<li>Extract QHND.Core.1.0.0.10.Windows-ARM64.zip (or <strong>latest driver available zipped file</strong>)</li>
 	<li>Run PreAlpha_QCHexagon_NPU_Driver installer</li>
 	<li>Verify that "Neural processors &gt; Snapdragon® X Elite … NPU" has the latest driver version as specified in the release notes included in the ZIP file.</li>
</ol>
With the driver package installed and the minimum versions of DirectML, ORT and Windows enabled, try this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectML_ESRGAN">ESRGAN super-resolution model sample</a> to build a C++ application that runs on the new Copilot+ PCs!
<h3>Developers who used DirectML on their Surface device from Aug. 29 through the latest Windows Surface Hardware Update in September 2024</h3>
If you downloaded the Alpha NPU Driver Package V0.0.0.9 to test DirectML on your Copilot+ PC, recent Windows Updates may have affected the NPU functionality. To maintain DirectML functionality and NPU operational stability, please install the latest driver package V1.0.0.10 as instructed above.

Although we recommend installing the latest driver package to resolve this issue, you may choose to uninstall v0.0.0.9 Alpha Driver Package instead:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Navigate to Settings/Apps/Installed apps</li>
 	<li>Search for “Pre-Alpha Qualcomm Hexagon (NPU) Driver”</li>
 	<li>Select the “...” and click on Uninstall.</li>
 	<li>Follow the steps to remove the driver</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Current capabilities and limitations</h3>
DirectML is rapidly expanding, and we are simplifying how developers can utilize the various local accelerators, hardware variations, and frameworks across Windows. There are constraints with what is available today and they are highlighted below:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>C++ Developers need to depend on DirectML 1.15. as a redistributable package within their app (reference the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectML_ESRGAN">sample</a> above)</li>
 	<li>NPU selection through the Python API for ONNX Runtime is not available currently but is coming soon!</li>
 	<li>Functionality has been verified on Surface Copilot+ PCs and limited other OEMs</li>
 	<li>There are <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/dml-ai-hub-models">specific models</a> that DirectML guarantees will work on Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU. Please leverage these exact ONNX versions during model sampling.
<ul>
 	<li>Developers will experience error code DXGI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED (0x887A0004) stating “The specified device interface or feature level is not support on this system.” when attempting to use models outside of <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/dml-ai-hub-models">supported models</a>.</li>
 	<li>For testing any models outside of our supported list, developers may enable windows developer mode (settings/systems/for developers). Models that are run in this mode may have undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

WebNN is an emerging web standard that defines how to run machine learning models in the browser and offers new possibilities for bringing AI innovations to the web. It defines how to interface with hardware acceleration APIs such as DirectML, enabling web sites to leverage the GPU or NPU on a user’s PC to run AI locally. DirectML, a key foundational component of the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/">Windows Copilot Runtime</a>, uniquely simplifies how developers can scale their AI innovations, through a single, cross-hardware DirectX API that provides a secure, consistent, performant experience across different hardware architectures. WebNN also supports integration with machine learning frameworks, like ONNX Runtime Web (ORT Web), which is part of the ONNX Runtime project. ORT Web is a JavaScript library that enables you to run ONNX models in the web browser and extends the Execution Provider (EP) framework to include WebNN as an EP.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57089 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/08/WebNN-Framework-Pic.png" alt="Diagram of WebNN Framework" width="300" height="294" />

Enabling DirectML across NPUs with WebNN is only possible with the support and close collaboration of hardware partners like Intel. Intel Fellow, Moh Haghighat, remarked: <em>“Intel is excited that WebNN and DirectML can now provide countless web developers the ability to harness the power and efficiency of Intel’s NPU for creating and executing innovative machine learning features in web applications on AI PCs. We eagerly look forward to the new possibilities that WebNN and DirectML bring to web developers and the web users around the world who will benefit from faster, smarter, and more engaging web applications.” </em>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building Windows apps that leverage on-device AI models can seem like a daunting task - there's a lot of work that goes into defining your use case, choosing and tuning the right models, and refining the logic surrounding the models.

While there's no quick and easy path to learning the ins and outs of AI on Windows, we are going to breakdown an application sample that was showcased at Build to help you see how on-device models can be leveraged to power up your applications.

The sample we will be looking at is an AI-empowered Audio Editor, built with WinUI3 and WinAppSDK. The application functionality itself is minimal, but provides a good framework to showcase the AI portion of the app.

<b>Audio Smart Trimming</b>

The Audio Editor app uses several models to enable "smart trimming" of audio, which has a flow like this:
<ol>
 	<li>User uploads an audio file that includes recognizable speech</li>
 	<li>They provide a theme keyword or phrase and a trim duration</li>
 	<li>The Audio Editor generates a trimmed audio clip that contains the most relevant segment of audio related to the provided theme</li>
</ol>
The input UI for this flow helps visualize what exactly is expected in the sample:

Once <em>Generate new clip</em> is clicked, the new audio clip is uploaded to the app and can be played for validation:

<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8">Now let’s </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8">take a look</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8"> at the models that were used to make this work.</span>

<b>Enabling Smart Trimming with Silero, Whisper, and MiniLML6v2</b>

For the "smart trimming" task, it takes three different models, all of them <a href="https://onnx.ai/onnx/">ONNX</a>, to process the input audio data into the output we are expecting. We'll break down what each model does, what it accomplishes for our use case, and where you can find more info on the models.

In order of usage:

<b>Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD)</b>

We use this model to "smart-chunk" our audio into smaller bits so that it can be processed by our transcription model.

This is necessary because Whisper (our transcription model) can only process thirty second snippets of audio at a time. We can't naively cut the audio at 30 second intervals because this would chop sentences in the middle, resulting in a transcription that didn't accurately reflect the structure and grammar of the spoken audio.

As a solution, we use Silero VAD to detect voice activity and cut on breaks in speaking, resulting in audio chunks that are small enough for Whisper to process, but are still properly sectioned portions of speech.

You can learn more about Silero VAD itself on <a href="https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/tree/master">GitHub</a>.

<strong>Whisper Tiny</strong>

After our audio has been chunked, we take the output and feed it to the Whisper Tiny model. This model transcribes speech to text and is probably the most straightforward step in our pipeline: audio chunks go in, and transcribed chunks come out.

We use the Tiny version of Whisper to optimize on performance, but it comes with some drawbacks, such as being limited to English and a possible drop off in accuracy. However, for our use case, it works great.

You can learn more about Whisper Tiny, or its variants, on <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny">HuggingFace</a>.

<strong>MiniLM</strong>

The last model we use is a text embedding model called MiniLM. MiniLM maps written sentences to a multi-dimensional vector space that encapsulates all the semantic information contained in a sentence. In other words, this model maps all the things we inherently understand about language (like meaning, grammar, vocabulary, etc.) to a numerical representation of that information. This is useful for all sorts of tasks, but we will use it for semantic search.

For this sample, we take the text transcribed from our Whisper model, our input theme phrase to search on, and use MiniLM to generate text embeddings for both. Once we have our embeddings, we can calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine Similarity</a> between our theme phrase and embedded sections of our audio text to get the most semantically similar section of our audio.

From there, we just have to cut our audio based on the timestamps, load it into the player, and that's it!

You can learn more about MiniLM on <a href="https://huggingface.co/optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">HuggingFace</a>.

<b>Running the Sample and Checking out the Code</b>

If you want to run the sample for yourself, or dive into the implementation for some more details on how this all works, head over to this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-DevRel/tree/main/Samples/AudioEditor">repository</a> where the sample lives.

We also have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-DevRel/blob/main/Samples/AudioEditor/CodeWalkthrough.md">Code Walkthrough document</a> if you want an entry point into how this sample was written.

There's quite a bit of set-up that goes into getting all the models set up in the project (since they can't be checked into source control), but all the prerequisite steps are defined in the README. Go check it out!
