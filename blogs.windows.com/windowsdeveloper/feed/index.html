										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In every one of the billion Windows 10 devices worldwide, there is a GPU for accelerating your AI tasks. From photo editing applications enabling new user experiences through AI to tools that help you train machine learning models for your applications with little effort, DirectML accelerates these experiences by leveraging the computing power of any DirectX 12 GPU. Over a hundred applications already take advantage of DirectML—with over two hundred million hardware accelerated inferences performed daily on Windows. To make it even easier for applications to take advantage of DirectML, we are excited to announce the public release of DirectML as a standalone API for Win32, UWP, and WSL applications in a single NuGet package, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/">Microsoft.AI.DirectML</a>. Let's look at a few ways DirectML is used today and spark ideas for your own applications.

Healthcare is another field leveraging machine learning techniques in interesting ways. Consider a sonographer using an ultrasound device to evaluate fetal brain development during their patient’s pregnancy. Acquiring the required planes and taking the required measurements for this is challenging because it requires lots of manual input from the sonographer. This is where GE Healthcare’s Voluson™ Ultrasound Devices comes in handy: pre-trained neural networks help the sonographer using the ultrasound probe automatically segment specific imaging planes from a volume and perform manual measurements. Previously identifying the approriate planes and measurements required time consuming manual adjustments. GE Healthcare relies on Windows ML and DirectML for delivering consistent and reliable results across a broad range of their ultrasound devices.

An exciting area of growth is at the intersection of machine learning and real-time graphics in video games where performance is critical. Early applications in this area include using neural networks for superior image upscaling and filling in the sampling gaps of ray-traced images; these techniques are making it possible to present high-resolution gameplay without the cost of high-resolution rendering. The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectMLSuperResolution">DirectML Super Resolution sample</a> showcases how DirectML can integrate seamlessly with these real-time graphics intensive applications.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and new applications like these are introduced every day: models are used for transcribing audio, translating hand-written notes into text, fault detection in manufacturing, and many more! DirectML has provided the hardware acceleration support needed for these scenarios since Windows 10 version 1903. Now the DirectML NuGet package offers our latest hardware acceleration investments even sooner to framework and application developers. If your model is representable using the ONNX format, then you too can tap into DirectML.
<h2>Training Models with TensorFlow and Lobe</h2>
Accelerating inference is where DirectML started: supporting training workloads across the breadth of GPUs in the Windows ecosystem is the next step. In September 2020, we <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/09/08/open-sourcing-tensorflow-with-directml/">open sourced TensorFlow with DirectML</a> to bring cross-vendor acceleration to the popular TensorFlow framework. This project is all about enabling rapid experimentation and training on your PC, regardless of which GPU you have on your device, with a simple and painless setup process. We also know many machine learning developers depend on tools, libraries, and containerized workloads that only work with Unix-like operating systems, so DirectML runs in both Windows <em>and</em> the Windows Subsystem for Linux. DirectML makes it easy for you to work with the environment and GPU you already have.

Machine learning is also becoming increasingly accessible with tools like <a href="https://www.lobe.ai/">Lobe</a> – an easy to use app that has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. To get started, collect and label your images and Lobe will automatically train a custom machine learning model for you. On Windows, Lobe uses DirectML to deliver great performance across a wide range of GPUs. When training is done, you can try out your model and ship it to any platform you choose.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
Win32 APIs provide powerful functionality that let you get the most out of Windows in your applications. While these APIs are readily accessible to C and C++ developers, other languages like C# and Rust require wrappers or bindings in order to access these APIs. In C#, this is commonly known as platform invoking or P/Invoke.

Historically this has required developers to handcraft the wrappers or bindings, which is error prone and doesn’t scale to broad API coverage. In recent years, given the strong demand for calling Win32 APIs from various languages, several community projects have spawned to provide more strongly typed and idiomatic representations of these wrappers and bindings to provide an improved developer experience and spare developers the overhead of creating them themselves. Some notable projects include <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span></a> for .NET and <a href="https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winapi-rs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Rust</span>.

The main challenge with these projects is they are manually maintained, which makes broad and sustained API coverage difficult and costly, and their work doesn’t really benefit other languages.

As owners of the Windows SDK, we wanted to see where we could provide unique value here, take some of the burden off of the community, and make achieving broad and sustainable API coverage across languages a reality.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of this is our </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project and corresponding Win32 language projections now in preview on GitHub!</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Win32 Metadata</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project is to provide a complete description of the Win32 API surface in metadata so that it can be projected to any language in an automated way, improving correctness and minimizing maintenance overhead. The output of this project is effectively an ECMA-335 compliant Windows metadata file (winmd) published to Nuget.org containing metadata describing the entire Win32 API surface.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Win32 APIs have existed for a long time, so accurately describing all of them will take some iteration. We will be developing this tooling in the open and welcome community contributions to ensure an accurate representation of the Win32 API surface that will benefit all languages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this metadata to enable developers to call Win32 APIs idiomatically from the language of their choice, we need language projections built on top of it. The first such language projection is </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Built in partnership with Andrew Arnott, the owner of the </span><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project for .NET, </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parses the metadata and generates the P/Invoke wrappers required to call the APIs you care about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply add a reference to the Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32 package from NuGet.org and add a file called NativeMethods.txt to the root of your project with a list of Win32 functions you want to call. The file can contain one function per line or even wildcards like BCrypt.* for including entire modules. Once populated, </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will generate the P/Invoke wrappers for the functions you request and all of their dependencies.</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56107 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2021/01/CsWin32.gif" alt="" width="1572" height="925" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see in the animation above, after adding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CreateFile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to NativeMethods.txt and a using statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft.Windows.Sdk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> namespace, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CreateFile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be called via the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PInvoke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> static class. </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides rich Intellisense, strong types for parameters, and also includes the relevant documentation from </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">docs.microsoft.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all dynamically generated from metadata based on the APIs you request! No additional dependencies are required, broad API coverage is achieved with improved correctness and minimal maintenance overhead, and the APIs are expressed idiomatically as C# developers would expect.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn more about </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and try it for yourself by visiting the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#/Win32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just an early example of what’s possible with dynamically created projections of Win32 APIs. We envision projections like this for many languages, all expressing Win32 APIs in whatever idiomatic patterns developers of the language expect. The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rust crate is another example.</span><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust language projection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follows in the tradition established by </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++/WinRT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of building language projections for Windows using standard languages and compilers, providing a natural and idiomatic way for Rust developers to call Windows APIs. The </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crate lets you call any Windows API using code generated on the fly directly from the metadata, enabling you to call the APIs as if they were just another Rust module. It does not attempt to partition Windows APIs by technology, instead providing a single way to call any Windows API regardless of the underlying technology. You can seamlessly make use of APIs based on C-style exports, COM interfaces, or WinRT types. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Languages</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C#</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are also working on a </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cppwin32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern C++</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projection in the open on GitHub and welcome community contributions there. These projects are early previews and under active development so are subject to change significantly as we absorb feedback and make progress. We will work with the community to support other languages based on </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partnering with existing community projects where appropriate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the umbrella of the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win32metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, we hope to advocate a set of </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/docs/projections.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">principles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all language projections should follow for the best developer experience while providing flexibility for each projection to do what’s best for their community.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Win32 APIs more accessible to more languages will allow developers to make the most out of Windows regardless of their preferred language. We are excited to engage with the community to expand API coverage and language support and minimize the maintenance overhead of existing projects.</span>

The /Data <a href="https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=microsoft"><strong>Developer Economics Q1 2021 Survey</strong> </a>is now open! Every year more than 30,000 developers around the world participate in this survey. <a href="https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=microsoft">Take the survey now</a> to share your experience as a developer and your perspective on the future of the software industry. Want more information? Read our answers to the questions below!
<h2><strong>Is this survey for me?</strong></h2>
This survey is for all developers, whether you’re a professional, a hobbyist, or a student; building front-end, back-end, or full stack; working on desktop, web, gaming, cloud, mobile, IoT, AR/VR, machine learning, or data science.

The Developer Economics survey gives a chance for all developers to share their feedback and shape the future of the ecosystem. Answer questions about your skills, favorite programming languages, tools, platforms, and technologies. Your answers help predict where developers are going next and what they will need to succeed in 2021 and beyond. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, your views are valuable!
<h2><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></h2>
There are some perks that /Data offers with your participation:
<ul>
 	<li>A virtual goodie bag with resources and data to help you plan your next career move.</li>
 	<li>The survey results will be published on <a href="https://developereconomics.com/">developereconomics.com</a>, free for all developers who join the community.</li>
 	<li>A way to give back! For each qualified survey response /Data will donate USD $0.10 to <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>, empowering young women of color to embrace the tech marketplace.</li>
 	<li>A chance to win awesome prizes like an Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What sort of insights come out of this survey?</strong></h2>
Developers’ extra needs due to COVID-19 and a fresh view on who is into DevOps based on the activities developers are involved in, were just two of the trends that /Data identified in last summer’s survey. You can see the results for yourself at <a href="https://developereconomics.com/">developereconomics.com</a>.
<h2><strong>What’s in it for Microsoft?</strong></h2>
Developer Economics is an independent survey from /Data, an analyst firm in the developer economy that tracks global software developer trends. We’re interested in seeing the reports that come from this survey, and we want to ensure the broadest developer audience participates.

Of course, any data collected by this survey is between you and /Data. You should review their Terms &amp; Conditions page to learn more about the awarding of prizes, their data privacy policy, and how /Data will handle your personal data.

Ready to go?

The survey is open until February 8, 2021.
<h2><a href="https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=microsoft"><strong>Take the survey today</strong></a></h2>
The survey is available in English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Russian, Japanese, and Korean!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you tuned in to this morning’s App Development Community Standup, you know that today we released WinUI 3 Preview 3. If you want to skip the summary and head straight to the release notes and installation instructions, <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/preview3">you can find those here</a>.
<h2>New Features</h2>
The team has been hard at work on Preview 3 since the release of Preview 2 back in July. Countless bug fixes, exciting new capabilities, and improvements on existing capabilities will hopefully make this a great Preview for you all to try out. Here are some highlights from Preview 3 that are new since Preview 2:
<ul>
 	<li>ARM64 Support</li>
 	<li>Drag and drop inside and outside of apps</li>
 	<li>RenderTargetBitmap (only XAML content for now – SwapChainPanel content will be captured later)</li>
 	<li>Improvements to our tooling/developer experience:
<ul>
 	<li>Live Visual Tree, Hot Reload, Live Property Explorer and similar tools</li>
 	<li>Intellisense now working for WinUI 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/blob/main/dev/MRTCore/README.md">MRT Core Integration</a> – making apps faster and lighter on startup and providing quicker resource lookup</li>
 	<li>Custom cursor support</li>
 	<li>Off-thread input APIs</li>
</ul>
These changes continue to advance the capabilities of WinUI 3 for supporting heavy-duty, complex apps.  Your feedback has been vital to the advancement of this platform, so please keep that coming!  Let us know if you encounter bugs, what you wish worked differently, and what you’d like to see in the future by opening an issue on our <a href="https://aka.ms/winui/github">GitHub repo</a>. I’m also looking forward to hearing all of your questions about Preview 3 on our upcoming December Community Call, which will be held on 12/16.

Since this is a preview release, the usual caveats apply: you may still encounter some bumps in the road while using it. Please refer to the <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/preview3#known-issues-and-limitations">list of known issues and limitations</a> for tips.
<h2>Using WinUI 3 Preview 3</h2>
Preview 3 has a similar installation and setup process to Preview 2, but requires an updated version of Visual Studio (16.9), which will automatically download the latest .NET 5 for you as well, if you are interested in building Desktop apps. There are also a few sample apps you can look through: the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/#xaml-controls-gallery-winui-3-preview-3-branch">WinUI 3 version of the XAML Controls Gallery</a> where you can interact directly with all of the included controls, as well as the sample apps that you may have seen demo’ed at Build or Ignite – they’ve been updated to use Preview 3, and you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-3-Demos">find them here</a>.

We recommend creating <em>new</em> projects when using WinUI 3 Preview 3. The process of upgrading an app from Preview 2 to Preview 3 can quickly become tricky and complicated. However, if you’ve been working hard on a large-scale app with Preview 2 and don’t want to create new project files, we do have <a href="https://aka.ms/winui3/upgrade-instructions">a list of upgrade steps</a> that you can use as guidance.
<h2>What’s Next</h2>
Updates on post-Preview 3 planning and features will be posted on our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#winui-30-feature-roadmap">WinUI 3 feature roadmap</a>. Until then, you can always stay up-to-date with the WinUI team on <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml">GitHub</a>. Thanks for trying out Preview 3 and supporting WinUI – can’t wait to hear what you all think!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our mission is to create one of the most powerful, beautiful, and simple web rendering engines in the world. Our passion is to make it completely open and free for everyone.

Today we are proud to introduce the latest evolution of the Babylon Platform, the amazingly simple <strong>Babylon.js 4.2.</strong>

https://youtu.be/vkLZMHYj8d4

We are artists, developers, creators, and dreamers and we want to make it as simple as possible to enable everyone to bring their ideas to life. With this new version of Babylon.js, we set out to make it even easier to develop with. From a ton of new tools, to improved workflows and features, new documentation and more, it is our sincere hope that <strong>Babylon.js 4.2</strong> will make your development process faster and easier while unlocking new simple ways to work.

Before diving into more detail, we want to take a quick moment to humbly thank the incredible community that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing platform. Babylon.js would not be here without you.
<h3>Powerful New Particle Editor</h3>
You may already know that Babylon.js features a rich particle system with seemingly endless properties and features that you can leverage to create the perfect particle effect. Well, today it gets a whole lot easier. Welcome to the brand new Babylon.js Particle Editor. Built directly inside of the Inspector, you can now create particle systems with the click of the mouse. With direct UI access to nearly every particle system property, you can edit and shape the perfect particle system without writing a single line of code! And of course, you can export your particle system or save it to the snippet server to load into your Babylon.js scene with one simple line of code. Creating incredible particles has NEVER been more simple.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is the official GA release for .NET 5, and along with it we are excited to share the latest updates with our recent release of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/releases/tag/1.0.1.201020.1">C#/WinRT version 1.0</a>. C#/WinRT provides WinRT projection support for .NET 5 based apps. The Windows SDK leverages this technology and is now integrated with the .NET 5.0 SDK to expose Windows APIs through the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/frameworks#net-5-os-specific-tfms">Target Framework Monikers</a>. In addition to the Windows SDK support added for .NET 5, C#/WinRT itself allows component authors to build their own .NET 5 projections using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT/">CsWinRT NuGet package.</a>

To use the latest runtime and SDK updates in .NET 5, install the following:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5.0 SDK</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8</a></li>
</ul>
You can stay updated on the latest work with C#/WinRT by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT">CsWinRT Github repo</a>.
<h3><strong>Call Windows APIs with new TFMs in .NET 5</strong></h3>
C#/WinRT provides support for WinRT APIs in .NET 5 by generating Windows SDK projections and including them in the .NET 5.0 SDK along with a small runtime assembly. With this new support, Windows APIs should now be accessed using the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/frameworks#net-5-os-specific-tfms">Target Framework Monikers</a> feature. The new TFMs provide a simple and streamlined access to the Windows APIs in a .NET 5 app.

The following TFMs and corresponding SDK versions are supported:
<ul>
 	<li>net5.0-windows10.0.17763.0 (Windows 10, version 1809)</li>
 	<li>net5.0-windows10.0.18362.0 (Windows 10, version 1903)</li>
 	<li>net5.0-windows10.0.19041.0 (Windows 10, version 2004)</li>
</ul>
Note that the SDK version in the TFM is the Windows SDK version used to build your app, not the minimum OS version that your app will run on. The new TFMs in .NET 5 can be used in your project file or NuGet package generation, and this is the recommended method for targeting Windows in .NET 5 going forwards. To use TFMs in your project, simply add the following line of code to your project file with the desired SDK version:
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0-windows10.0.19041.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;</pre>
For more details on how to use Windows TFMs in your app, check out the blog post on <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/09/03/calling-windows-apis-in-net5/">Calling Windows APIs in .NET 5</a> as well as the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance">developer docs</a> for Windows desktop apps.
<h3><strong>Latest Windows Runtime Updates</strong></h3>
Version 1.0 of C#/WinRT includes the latest runtime updates that are shipped through our runtime assembly, <em>winrt.runtime.dll</em>, as part of the .NET 5.0 SDK. The runtime assembly and the Windows SDK projections are accessed through the .NET 5 TFMs mentioned above.

Some of the latest .NET 5 features we have added include C# function pointers for improved performance and implementing natural C#-style casts. To learn more about these updates, take a look at the blog post on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/improvements-in-native-code-interop-in-net-5-0/">improvements in native code interop in .NET 5</a>.

We have made performance improvements and fixed several critical bugs raised by the team as well as from developer feedback through our repo. Some of these fixes include:
<ul>
 	<li>Added projection support for ref const C# parameters</li>
 	<li>Fixes for <em>NullReferenceExceptions</em> when using C# <em>IDictionary</em> objects</li>
 	<li>Resolved issues with using <em>WindowsRuntimeBufferExtensions</em> methods</li>
 	<li>Several bug-fixes involving <em>InvalidCastExceptions</em></li>
</ul>
We have also addressed several bugs with WinUI, which uses C#/WinRT projections for their framework. Due to the nature of these recent changes, all component libraries and apps that use C#/WinRT or the Windows APIs must update to the .NET 5 GA release. For a full list of changes between .NET 5 RC2 and RTM, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/releases/tag/1.0.1.201020.1">v1.0 release on our Github repo</a>.
<h3><strong>C#/WinRT Projection Support for Component Authors</strong></h3>
The C#/WinRT project provides support for component authors to build C# projection assemblies of their components which can then be consumed by C# app developers. By referencing the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT/">CsWinRT NuGet package</a>, component authors can generate an assembly using our improved project tooling in Visual Studio.

An <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/Samples/Net5ProjectionSample">end-to-end sample</a> has been added to our repo showing how to generate a .NET 5 projection from a C++/WinRT component, and how to distribute and consume the projection assembly as a NuGet package. This <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/csharp-winrt/net-projection-from-cppwinrt-component">walkthrough of the sample</a> in the C#/WinRT docs provides more details. You can read more about the tooling experience for generating a projection in the last <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/10/13/c-winrt-version-0-8-and-the-net5-rc2-release/">C#/WinRT blog post</a>.
<h3><strong>Closing</strong></h3>
C#/WinRT has enabled .NET 5 to <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdotnet%2Fruntime%2Fissues%2F37672&amp;data=04%7C01%7CZhang.Angela%40microsoft.com%7Cb8918f5488b744709b2708d880fb608d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637401164436976035%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=YGJ0iWewjIxfOqN92z2NpLvVyPT1bXlxU0hw6JirbYw%3D&amp;reserved=0">remove built-in WinRT support</a> so that the WinRT ecosystem and .NET runtime can now innovate independently. We have also provided the tools for component authors to build C# projection assemblies for their .NET 5 consumers to use.

Up next for the team, we are working on authoring support for C# .NET 5 developers to create their own C#/WinRT components. These new capabilities will be available in a future release of C#/WinRT—keep up to date with the latest changes on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT">CSWinRT repo</a>.]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have several important updates to share with the latest release of C#/WinRT. This release is feature complete for consumption scenarios, which means that all features for using our generated Windows SDK projections to call WinRT APIs are now in their final form. We expect C#/WinRT to have parity with .NET Native and .NET Core 3, and we encourage customers to update to .NET5 RC2 and give us feedback before our final release in November.

First, with the latest <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT/0.8.0">CsWinRT NuGet package</a> we have added tooling improvements for component authors. These improvements make it easy for component authors to generate a C# projection by simply referencing the NuGet package and specifying a few project properties.  To demonstrate this functionality, we have added an end-to-end sample for component authors to the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT">CsWinRT repo</a>.

Second, we have made runtime updates that ship in the .NET5 RC2 release. The runtime and generated projection code now take advantage of many .NET5 features such as Function Pointers for improved performance and IDynamicInterfaceCastable (IDIC) to implement natural C#-style casts. The latter has allowed us to fix several bugs involving InvalidCastExceptions. These latest C#/WinRT updates have been integrated into the Windows SDK projections for .NET5 RC2. To use these latest updates, install the newest release of Visual Studio, version 16.8 Preview 4, which includes the .NET5 RC2 SDK.
<h2><strong>
C#/WinRT Tooling Experience</strong></h2>
<strong>Improved C#/WinRT Tooling</strong>

We have improved the C#/WinRT tooling experience for component authors. Component authors can now add a reference to the CsWinRT NuGet package and specify a few project properties to easily generate a projection, which can then be consumed in a .NET5 application.

The following C# project file code snippet demonstrates how to use this updated tooling with a C++/WinRT component project named “SimpleMathComponent” in your solution. To build the projection using C#/WinRT, all you need is a project reference to the component project and the <em>CsWinRTIncludes</em> property which specifies which namespaces to project.
<pre>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;ProjectReference Includes = “..\SimpleMathComponent\SimpleMathComponent.vcxproj”&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;CSWinRTIncludes&gt;SimpleMathComponent&lt;/CSWinRTIncludes&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</pre>
Building a project with these properties along with a reference to the CsWinRT NuGet package will invoke the <em>cswinrt.exe </em>tool behind the scenes, generating your C# interop code and assembly. The generated assembly can then be used in a .NET5 application.

You can also specify additional project properties to customize the behavior of C#/WinRT, such as which namespaces to exclude from building the projection and the location for generated project source files. For more details on this updated tooling, refer to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/blob/master/nuget/readme.md">this document</a>.

<strong>Component Author Sample </strong>

We have added an <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/tree/master/Samples/Net5ProjectionSample">end to end sample</a> for component authors to our repo. This sample expands upon the example code snippet above using a “SimpleMathComponent” with basic math operations. It shows component authors how to generate a .NET5 projection and NuGet package from the C++/WinRT component, and how to consume the NuGet package from a .NET5 console application. The projection C# project file in this sample demonstrates how to invoke <em>cswinrt.exe</em> with the new tooling support.

To use this sample, you can follow along with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/csharp-winrt/net-projection-from-cppwinrt-component">associated walkthrough</a> in our docs.
<h2><strong>
C#/WinRT Runtime Updates</strong></h2>
<strong>New Features</strong>

We have recently completed feature work for IDynamicInterfaceCastable (IDIC) in our latest .NET5 projections. This makes it possible to now use natural C# style casts for projected interfaces. With IDIC we have also been able to fix several InvalidCastException bugs that early adapters have run into.

Here is an example using the new IDIC functionality in a .NET5 C# project:
<pre>var agileObject = (IAgileObject)(object)new 
Windows.Foundation.WwwFormUrlDecoder("https://www.microsoft.com");</pre>
In this example, we cast an object of type <em>Windows.Foundation.WWWFormUrlDecoder</em> from the Windows Runtime APIs to <em>IAgileObject</em>, which is a type projected by C#/WinRT. With IDIC we are now able to make this cast, whereas before you would have to explicitly use the method <em>object.As()</em>.

C#/WinRT now also uses function pointers in the runtime and the projection code it generates, resulting in improved performance.

<strong>
Breaking Changes </strong>

There are a few breaking changes with our latest C#/WinRT projections for the .NET5 RC2 release, including some of the updates mentioned above. A <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/blob/master/docs/breakingchanges-rc2.md">list of known breaking changes</a> has been added to the CsWinRT repo.

The main changes for .NET5 RC2 include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>We have added strong name signing to the SDK and runtime assembly, <i>winrt.runtime.dll</i>. This means that assemblies built with previous versions of <em>winrt.runtime.dll</em> are not compatible, including the Windows SDK and WinUI. All dependencies will have to be updated to the latest .NET5 RC2 versions.</li>
 	<li>Some WinRT types may have differences in default values when projected, which may raise issues if relying on default values. For example, <em>Foundation.DateTime </em>is projected to <em>System.DateTimeOffset</em> in C# and these types have different default values.</li>
 	<li>The <em>add </em>event accessor return type has changed from <em>Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.EventRegistrationToken</em><em> </em>to <em>void</em>. We no longer project the <em>System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime</em><em> </em>namespace, as it has been removed from .NET5.</li>
 	<li>Projected XAML classes still require an explicit registration in the app startup path. This will be fixed in the RTM release. Here is an example of the code you would need to add:</li>
</ul>
<pre>public App() {
   WinRT.ComWrappersSupport.RegisterProjectionAssembly(typeof(App).Assembly);
}
</pre>
<strong>
Known Issues</strong>

Known issues to note with this release of C#/WinRT include:
<ul>
 	<li>ReadyToRun is not supported for applications using the .NET5 Windows 10 TFM. These applications should install the latest .NET5 SDK from the RTM branch to get the fix. More details can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/issues/442">issue</a>.</li>
 	<li>.NET5 RC2 is not compatible with WinUI 3 Preview 2. This will be resolved in WinUI 3 Preview 3.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>
Summary</strong></h2>
These newest updates with C#/WinRT version 0.8 and the .NET5 RC2 release have introduced improved tooling for component authors, closed feature gaps with .NET5, and addressed several bugs that developers have been facing. We continue to work on fixing bugs and improving performance for the .NET5 RTM release in November, as well as adding project support for Authoring &amp; Hosting.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building great apps on Windows should be easier – no matter how your app is written.  We want to ensure you have a path forward to make your apps better on Windows and we’re doing that with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/05/19/developing-for-all-1-billion-windows-10-devices-and-beyond/">Project Reunion</a>.  We’re creating a unified app platform that allows you to focus on your app and take advantage of new or existing code.  We also know you need a great development environment and tools that help you stay productive. Today, at Microsoft Ignite I’m excited to share the progress we’ve made to simplify app development and give you a great developer experience.
<h2>Simplifying app development</h2>
With <a href="https://aka.ms/projectreunion">Project Reunion</a>, we are unifying access to existing Win32 and UWP APIs, and we’re doing the design in the open so we can continue to engage with you and build a better Windows platform.  We will provide a common platform for new apps and APIs so that they will work down-level across supported versions of Windows. They will be faster, leaner, and more engaging.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-55993 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/09/image001.png" alt="Project Reunion diagram" width="1102" height="541" />

With <a href="https://aka.ms/projectreunion">Project Reunion</a>, you can choose components that makes sense for your app, without having to completely rewrite your app.  We are decoupling the platform to enable you take advantage of new capabilities in the OS and hardware.  This is evident with our progress to WinUI, WebView2 and other app model features which are all components of Project Reunion.  These updates will be available in the coming months.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://aka.ms/winui">WinUI</a> 3 Preview 3, dramatically improves your development experience with tools like XAML Intellisense, Hot Reload, and the Live Visual Tree editor in Visual Studio are all available for C++ and C# apps. You can also use multiple windows and custom window styles with XAML's windowing APIs.  These updates allow you to work with your existing code and allow you to create apps for ARM64.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://aka.ms/webview2">WebView2</a> can be enabled with Win32 C/C++, .NET (WPF/WinForms), and WinUI 3.  You can host web content in native apps using the new <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-edge%2Fwebview2%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cjanlee%40microsoft.com%7C9523f64f06c445f5693d08d858e39843%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C637357081848771012%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=wCVdJM9JQ5obunarSrZXN5TtDnE08BzPm6h20B8DZ1s%3D&reserved=0">WebView2 Runtime</a>. This allows you to bypass the dependency on a specific version of Microsoft Edge being installed on your user’s PC.</li>
 	<li>App Model features including <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/111">app lifecycle management</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/tree/master/dev/MRTCore">MRTCore</a>, and the ability to reference system wide <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/89">MSIX Framework packages</a> will enable apps using Project Reunion to have a lighter footprint on user’s systems. Your apps can take advantage of this while using existing deployment mechanisms so you can incrementally improve your existing apps at your own pace.</li>
</ul>
Please continue to engage with us and give us your feedback on <a href="https://aka.ms/projectreunion">Project Reunion</a>, our goal is to open source as much of the Reunion platform as possible.  You can also learn more about the above announcements for <a href="https://aka.ms/webview2">WebView2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/111">app lifecycle management</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/tree/master/dev/MRTCore">MRTCore</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/89">MSIX Framework packages</a>.
<h2>Delivering great developer experiences</h2>
To build engaging apps, you need great tools and an environment that allows you to stay focused and productive.  To help you achieve that, we’re releasing updates to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows Terminal, and React Native for Windows that you can start using this month.

The latest capabilities to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will enhance performance, provide better support for apps, and makes it easier to use.  We have backported WSL 2 to Windows version 1903 or higher, giving all WSL 2 users the same performance parity as Windows 10 version 2004.  We also added support for Linux graphical user interface (GUI) apps to Insider builds to help improve your workflow.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-55990 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-16-093521.png" alt="The Linux GUI apps GIMP and gedit running side by side on the Windows Subsystem for Linux" width="1797" height="1017" />

In <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1-4-release/">Windows Terminal Preview</a> 1.4 you can streamline your experience within your terminal.  You can click on links inside your terminal and have them open in your default browser or make jump lists so users can open the terminal from the start menu or task bar.  With the new command palette for Windows Terminal you can navigate and interact with your user’s terminals allowing you to see and access all commands in one place.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-55991 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/09/terminal-jump-list.png" alt="Terminal profile from the task bar" width="414" height="553" />

With <a href="http://aka.ms/rnblog">React Native for Windows v.0.63</a>, you can create new apps for Windows 10 or upgrade existing apps without having to learn or use new code.  In this latest version, you get new features like navigation support, improved theming support, automatic linking of native modules, and services to allow inter-module communication.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-55992 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/09/image005.gif" alt="React Native for Windows theming API" width="800" height="450" />

We look forward to sharing more with you in the open and we hope that you will continue to engage with us.  Together, we’ll create better apps for Windows and for all 1 billion Windows 10 devices.  If you didn’t get enough at Ignite, you can find additional Windows developer content about <a href="http://aka.ms/PR216">MSIX</a>, <a href="http://aka.ms/PR220">CS WinRT</a>, <a href="http://aka.ms/PR221">WinRTC</a> and more on the <a href="https://aka.ms/virtualhub/windows">Windows Virtual Hub</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[UWP applications (both apps and games) are a pivotal part of the Xbox experience. As we near the launch of the new console generation, we want to address some common questions regarding app and game development on the new Xbox family of consoles. If you have been developing for the Xbox One X using UWP and leveraging the Dev Mode Activation App, the same features will be supported on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.  Please refer to the following FAQs for further guidance.

Thank you for your partnership with Xbox!

FAQs:
<ul>
 	<li>Will my current UWP app or game continue running on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?
<ul>
 	<li>Yes, apps and games running on the Xbox One should continue to run at parity on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The underlying platform APIs and codecs that UWP apps are built on have been tested and validated with key scenarios by Microsoft and through thousands of hours of usage in our internal Xbox flighting program. These APIs and codes are supported on the new Xbox family of consoles. When the new Xbox family of consoles is released, we recommend doing additional validation of your UWP app or game on the chosen device if desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>How can I verify that my UWP app or game is working on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?
<ul>
 	<li>Devkits are not publicly available. UWP application developers should continue to rely on the Dev Mode Activation App used on the Xbox One X to convert their retails consoles into a development kit to test for compatibility As the same APIs and codecs are used between the Xbox One X and the new Xbox family of consoles, an app that works on the Xbox One X should continue to work on the new Xbox family of consoles</li>
 	<li>When the new Xbox family of consoles are available in retail, app partners can rely on Dev Mode Activation App to convert those consoles into a development kit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Do I need to change or rewrite my application from the current UWP application?
<ul>
 	<li>No app development changes are required for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You use the same SDK, build environments, and UWP APIs to develop your applications. The same publishing process for UWPs on the Xbox One will continue to apply for the new Xbox family of consoles.</li>
 	<li>As a reference, here are the links to the UWP documentation: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/getting-started">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/getting-started</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Are there any features my app can take advantage of for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?
<ul>
 	<li>We focused our efforts on backwards compatibility for apps on our new Xbox family of consoles to make it easier for our partners and enable a seamless transition for your app from the Xbox One generation to the next generation of Xbox consoles. This means that all of your favorite apps will carry over to the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on day 1.</li>
 	<li>We currently do not have additional features for apps on the new Xbox family of consoles that are not already a part of the Xbox One X.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Will I need to sign a new agreement to bring my Xbox One UWP application to the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S?
<ul>
 	<li>No, the existing Store App Developer Agreement terms will continue to cover distribution for apps on the new Xbox family of consoles. No additional agreements are required to run your app on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Will my app show that it supports the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on the Store?
<ul>
 	<li>Yes, Microsoft will list the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S as a platform on the Store PDP. No additional work is required from the app partner to add in Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S listing to the Store</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
