										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are developers, artists, creators, and dreamers and we want to make it as simple as possible to enable everyone to bring their ideas to life. With this new version of Babylon.js, we set out to make it even easier to develop web experiences through the addition of several new tools.
<h3><strong>Node Material Ray Marching</strong></h3>
One of the most used features in Babylon.js is the Node Material. This advanced material type allows you to create incredibly complicated and interactive shaders without writing a single line of code! With Babylon.js 6.0 we’ve done a lot of plumbing under the hood to make it more powerful than ever. With this work it is now possible for developers to build more advanced 3D Graphics techniques into Node Material shaders including things like Ray Marching.

Check out a Ray Marching proof of concept using the new Node Material changes <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34">here.</a>

The following gif is a wonderful demo from Adobe that shows off their own implementation of ray marching using this Babylon.js advancement!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56711 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/6-rayMarching.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<h3><strong>Node Material Tri-Planar and Bi-Planar Projection Nodes</strong></h3>
With Babylon.js 6.0, we’ve also added two exciting new nodes to the Node Material. The new Tri-planar Projection node allows you to project textures onto 3D objects regardless of the mesh UVs. It uses three separate 2D texture projections, one for each axis, and blends them together to create a material without seams. In simpler terms, it’s an advanced way to map textures to a mesh that do not account for the mesh’s UV layout. In addition to the Tri-planar node, we’ve also added a Bi-planar node. It works in a similar way using two 2D textures instead of 3, saving GPU calculations and ultimately leading to seamless textures with a smaller hit to performance!

Check it out: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34">https://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34</a>

Here’s a great article by Martin Palko to learn more about tri-planar projection: <a href="https://www.martinpalko.com/triplanar-mapping/">https://www.martinpalko.com/triplanar-mapping/</a>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56712 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/7-planarProjection.gif" alt="" width="500" height="333" />
<h3><strong>GUI Editor v1</strong></h3>
In Babylon.js 5.0 we introduced a GUI Editor Beta, giving you access to a far simpler way to create complex GUI designs for your Babylon scenes. With Babylon.js 6.0, the GUI Editor officially comes out of Beta with the release of version 1! This version builds on the Beta with a ton of stability improvements and bug fixes, but most importantly introduces a tighter connection to your Babylon.js playgrounds. Make a change in the GUI Editor, see it update instantly in your actual scene!

<h3><strong>Figma to Babylon.js Community Extension</strong></h3>
One of the most exciting parts about making open-source software is the incredible community of contributors that roll up their sleeves to help improve and extend it, making it more powerful and beneficial for everyone! With Babylon.js 6.0, we are incredibly grateful to welcome a brand new community extension from <a href="https://github.com/jamessimo">James Simonson</a> that allows you to export <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> GUI designs directly into Babylon.js scenes!

Learn more here: https://doc.babylonjs.com/communityExtensions/figmaToBabylonJS

<h3><strong>Accessibility Screen Reader Support</strong></h3>
When we think about making Babylon.js simpler for developers to use, this also includes making it simpler for developers to communicate with their audience. In the past, developers needed to manually expose content within the canvas to accessibility tools creating a need to manage both canvas elements and DOM elements simultaneously.

With Babylon.js 6.0, we are thrilled to announce that the core Babylon.js scene tree is now visible to screen readers. Thanks to the incredible work from <a href="https://github.com/mysunnytime">Sunny</a>, this advancement means that your favorite accessibility screen reader can now narrate scene elements and text to describe the scene to the user. It’s our sincere hope that this addition will make it significantly easier for developers to create Babylon.js scenes that are more accessible for everyone and especially for visually impaired people across the web.

You can try it out yourself by enabling your OS/Browser screen reader in your settings and opening this playground: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com/#I6V1ST#240">https://playground.babylonjs.com/#I6V1ST#240</a>

<h3><strong>Reorganized Documentation</strong></h3>
With a platform as feature-rich and advanced as Babylon, helping people learn how to use it is critically important. We’ve listened closely to our community over the past year to restructure the organization of Babylon.js documentation with Babylon.js 6.0. This new organization restructures the same great information in a way that’s more accessible to two core learning paths: those that want to first learn about Babylon.js and its feature set, and those that want to first understand how to integrate Babylon.js into their existing web applications. While there are many different types of learning objectives out there, these two paths represent the majority of new Babylon.js learners and this new documentation structure will better set them up for success as they begin their learning journey in the wonderful world of Babylon.js.

This meaningful documentation restructure was the result of deep thinking and exhaustive work from John King, a devoted teacher and passionate Babylon.js community member who lost a battle to cancer earlier this year. Thank you for teaching us John.

Start your Babylon.js learning journey today!

<h3><strong>Thank You</strong></h3>
With each evolution of Babylon.js comes a revolution in web rendering technology and an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. The Babylon platform simply wouldn’t be possible without the incredible community of developers, the 400+ contributors, and the steadfast advocates that contribute their knowledge, expertise, help, and passion to this amazing technology. “Thank you” to each one of you for all that you do to help make Babylon.js one of the most powerful, beautiful, simple, and open web rendering platforms in the world.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Reach the right customers at the right time with your games and apps</h3>
Content is at the heart of the Windows PC experience. Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life—moving from smartphones to PCs and back again—the lines between “mobile” and “desktop” have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps—a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.
<h3>Reach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56679" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/02/store-ads-picture-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="547" />

Our passion for helping <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">developers</a> more easily bring their apps to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/11-things-to-know-about-the-new-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">customers</a> inspired us to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">redesign the Microsoft Store</a> on Windows—which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile. Now, when customers visit the Microsoft Store, they can download apps for either mobile or PC.

With Microsoft Store Ads, developers now have new app discoverability opportunities on Windows. <em>Microsoft</em> Store Ads is all desktop traffic, with mission-driven users that have a high intent to download a desktop app. The opportunity is vast; 2022 was a record year, with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">over 900 million unique users worldwide utilizing the Microsoft Store, and a 122% year-over-year increase in developer submissions</a> of new apps and games.

Microsoft Store Ads was designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time, and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.

Whether you're about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.
<h3>All developers are welcome</h3>
We are now offering a new set of <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Open App Store Principles</a> that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/">publishing your Windows app.</a>

<a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/microsoft-store-ads?s_cid=en-us-gct-web-src_ext-sub_0-cam_developerblog-flx_msftstoread">All developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads,</a> where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. However, only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.
<h3><strong>Get started today</strong></h3>
Microsoft Store Ads is built for apps already on Windows—and for your latest release. Now is the time to promote and invest in your desktop app. Having <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/microsoft-store-grows-with-the-developer-community/">just announced ads on the Microsoft StoreOpens in new window</a>, the costs per click (CPC) are very competitive, which can bring your overall cost per action (CPA) down.

We recommend developers reach out to their marketing team to create a strategic app marketing plan leveraging Microsoft Store Ads. Let the team know that with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/more-content-and-new-developer-opportunities-in-the-microsoft-store/">Microsoft Store Ads</a> you promote your desktop app to customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices by creating ads on the Microsoft Advertising platform. Once created, developers will see their app advertised live right on the Microsoft Store. Customers will click the ad, download or update the app to their PC, and let the writing, playing, or gaming come to life.

Choose your way to get started:
<ul>
 	<li>Ask your marketing team to reach out to their Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative.</li>
 	<li>If your marketing team does not have a Microsoft Advertising account manager or Microsoft Store representative, <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-advertising-support?s_int=en-us-gct-web-src_msaweb-sub_blog-flx_storeadslaunch">Contact Us</a>.</li>
 	<li>If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/">publishing your Windows app.</a></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Windows App SDK 1.2 is now available! With WinAppSDK 1.2 you can now create widgets for the Windows 11 widget board, use the most modern WinUI controls – including media playback & InfoBadge, and support HDR graphics through the DisplayInformation APIs among other additional features. We have also made several updates to improve platform reliability, stability, and performance to help you create robust, powerful, applications for Windows.

Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful & powerful Windows desktop apps. These APIs and tools can be used in a consistent way by any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app on a broad set of target Windows OS versions. WinAppSDK stays up to date with frequent, OS independent releases and supports the latest innovations in Windows app development – including .NET & Visual Studio.
<h3>Get started with Windows App SDK</h3>
To start using Windows App SDK, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/">Get started with Windows App SDK</a> to set up your development environment and learn more about the components included in this release. If you want to jump right in with building your first WinUI 3 desktop app, start with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app?pivots=winui3-packaged-csharp">tutorial</a> or watch our <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/0a0b3638-b56a-49e2-84f5-44eb8441423c?WT.mc_id=learnlive-20220524E">Learn Live session</a> released at Build 2022.
<h2>Functionality introduced in Windows App SDK 1.2</h2>
<h3>Widgets for third-party applications</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56644" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture1-2.png" alt="" width="740" height="600" />

With the launch of Windows 11, we introduced the widgets board featuring content curated by Windows. Widgets provide a glanceable view of important information with one touch access from the taskbar or swipe from the left side of a touch screen and are populated by apps currently installed on the device. Now with the launch of Windows App SDK 1.2, we are excited to make this functionality available for third-party developers to create widgets for their packaged Win32 apps and test them locally on the Windows 11 widgets board through our Windows Insider Program.  By creating widgets for your apps, your customers can easily and seamlessly stay up to date with information that matters to them.

To get started developing Widgets for your app, check out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/widgets/widget-service-providers">Widgets development docs</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/widgets/widgets-design-fundamentals">Widgets design fundamentals</a> for prerequisites, guidance and best practices.
<h3>Latest WinUI controls including media playback</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56645" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/WASDK-UI-Collage.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" data-wp-editing="1" />

WinUI 3 apps can play audio and video with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediaplayerelement?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaPlayerElement</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mediatransportcontrols?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">MediaTransportControls</a> media playback controls. For more info on how and when to use media controls, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/media-playback">Media players</a>.

WinUI 3 has been updated with the latest controls, styles, and behaviors from WinUI 2.8. These updates include the addition of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.infobadge"><strong>InfoBadge</strong> </a>control, improvements to accessibility and high contrast mode, as well as bug fixes across controls. For more details, see the release notes for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.7">WinUI 2.7</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/release-notes/winui-2.8">WinUI 2.8</a>.
<h3>Voice and video calling in WinUI 3 apps via Azure Communication Services (ACS)</h3>
You can now add <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-calls?pivots=platform-windows">voice</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-video?pivots=platform-windows">video</a> calling capabilities to your WinUI 3 applications that run on Windows, enabling rich communication experiences for desktop PCs. Azure Communication Services use the same infrastructure, services, and technologies that power Microsoft Teams calling experiences.

Check out our conceptual documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features">overview</a> and try out quick starts and samples:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add voice calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling?pivots=platform-windows#winui-3-sample-code">Add 1:1 video calling to your WinUI 3 app</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>DisplayInformation</h3>
Windows desktop apps can now support High Dynamic Range (HDR) and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/auto-color-management/">Auto Color Management</a> (ACM) through the DisplayInformation class in WinAppSDK. This API is easier to use than ever before for Win32 apps, and app developers can now use one API to target <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/release-health/release-information">Windows version 1809 </a> and later. The DisplayInformation class enables you to monitor display-related information for an application view. This includes events to allow clients to monitor for changes in the application view affecting which display(s) the view resides on, as well as changes in displays that can affect the application view.
<h3>Support for Visual Studio Arm64</h3>
As early as Project Reunion (now WinAppSDK) 0.5, apps developed with WinAppSDK were able to <em>run</em> on Arm64. Starting with Visual Studio 17.3 Preview 2, you will be able to natively develop applications with WinAppSDK on Arm64 devices.

To get started developing on an Arm64 device, check out our docs detailing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/arm/overview">Windows on Arm</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio/">Arm64 Visual Studio</a>.
<h3>Trimming for .NET apps</h3>
You are now able to publish your .NET WinAppSDK apps trimmed. With CsWinRT 2.0, the C#/WinRT projections distributed in the WinAppSDK are trimmable. Publishing your app trimmed can reduce the disk footprint of your app by removing any unused code from trimmable binaries. Your app may also see a startup performance improvement. With a basic Hello World app, we have seen a ~80% disk footprint improvement and a ~7% startup performance improvement when published trimmed. With WinUI gallery, we have seen a ~45% disk footprint improvement.

For more details on how you can enable trimming, trimming limitations (such as reflection against trimmable types), and trim warnings, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained">Trim self-contained deployments and executables</a>.
<h3>Dynamic Refresh Rate</h3>
Introduced in Windows 11, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic Refresh Rate</a> (DRR) enables devices to seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on what users are doing on their PC. This helps to balance performance and power consumption. As part of WinUI 3 in Windows App SDK 1.2, Microsoft.UI.Composition will now support Dynamic Refresh Rate on devices that opt-in to the feature. Notably, through supporting DRR, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22557/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20expanding%20Dynamic,then%20restart%20Edge.">devices running Windows 22H2</a> will automatically have smoother scrolling and interactions in your app without any other changes.

To learn more about how to best support Dynamic Refresh Rate in your app, check out our <a href="https://aka.ms/drrtoolcode">Dynamic Refresh Rate Tool</a> (built on WinAppSDK 1.1) which shows how to use the <a href="https://aka.ms/compositorclock">Compositor Clock API</a> and support SwapChains.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56664" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/11/GIF-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" />
<h3>AppNotificationBuilder</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56647" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/10/Picture2.png" alt="" width="800" height="386" />

In Windows App SDK 1.1, we introduced the ability to create and send notifications from your application or a cloud service. App notifications can be used to inform the user of application status or state changes, or to prompt the user to take action with engaging and rich UI.

With WinAppSDK 1.2, we’re introducing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.appnotifications.builder.appnotificationbuilder?view=windows-app-sdk-1.2">AppNotificationBuilder</a>, an alternative to XML payload to simplify creating and defining these notifications. To get started using the AppNotificationBuilder to create app notifications, check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/release/1.2-preview1/specs/AppNotifications/AppNotificationContentSpec/AppNotificationBuilder-spec.md">AppNotificationBuilder spec</a> on GitHub. Also see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart">Quickstart: App notifications in the Windows App SDK</a> for an example of how to create a desktop Windows application that sends and receives local app notifications.
<h3>Additional updates</h3>
Outside of the new functionality introduced in WinAppSDK 1.2, there are also several performance, reliability, and development experience improvements. Of note, the WinAppSDK 1.2 binary on x64 is 11% smaller than WinAppSDK 1.1.5.

Check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.2/1.2.0/release-notes">release notes</a> for the full list of fixed issues and updates in WinAppSDK 1.2.
<h3>Upcoming experiences on WinAppSDK</h3>
We are working with several development partners internal and external to Microsoft who are migrating their experiences to WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK. Stay tuned on our social channels for more information about these partnerships.
<h3>Staying in the loop</h3>
You can stay up to date with the team on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK">Windows App SDK GitHub repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI GitHub repo</a>, and through our monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_J2v67C23ZqsolUDaHoFkF1GKvGrttB">WinUI Community Calls</a> where we share roadmap updates and other exciting news, and we demo new features.

You can also connect with us on Twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WindowsAppSDK">#WindowsAppSDK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUI">@WindowsUI</a>.

We look forward to seeing the beautiful apps you create with WinAppSDK 1.2 & WinUI 3!

Happy Coding!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago we created a code sample for enterprise developers called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/tree/master/">Customer Orders Database</a>, designed to demonstrate how developers can create and manage customer accounts, orders, and products for the fictitious company Contoso.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56601 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1-1.png" alt="Customer Orders Database" width="624" height="412" />

It was very popular, so we continued updating it to support each new version of Windows and the Windows App SDK, and to demonstrate current design guidance. Last year <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/blob/master/windows-11-update.md">we updated it to use WinUI 2.6</a>.

In May of this year, just in time for Microsoft Build, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/microsoft/windows-appsample-customers-orders-database/customers-orders-database-sample/">we gave it a major overhaul to work with Windows App SDK</a>, and to support the latest Azure features. Of course, we had to make it look at home on Windows 11. So now, based on WinUI 3, the Customer Order Database showcases UI controls including a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/datagrid">data grid</a> from the Windows Community Toolkit.

Making use of Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, Sqlite and SQL Azure database integration, the Entity Framework, and cloud API services.

We hope this is just the beginning for the Customer Orders Database code sample, and we’d like your help making future versions even better.

So we’re asking you, what else should the sample do?

What other features would you like the sample to include? What’s stopping you from using it as the basis for a project in your enterprise? Let us know what you think so that we can start adding features and improving our documentation to meet the communities' specific wants and needs. Our goal is to help you create a solid app, built using current best practices, that you can use as a foundation for your own projects. At the very least, you can examine the code and see how it’s done.

Share your feedback with <a href="mailto:winsam@microsoft.com">winsam@microsoft.com</a> and we’ll follow up with another blog post when we have the next update of the sample.

Thanks!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<h3>July 2022</h3>
It has been exciting to see feedback on the Windows Subsystem for Android™, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mobile-apps-on-windows-abed2335-81bf-490a-92e5-fe01b66e5c48">the core engine behind Mobile Apps on Windows</a> since we first made it available to our Windows Insiders audience last October. While we obviously appreciate the words of encouragement, we also value the suggestions on how we can do better. We’ve been able to act on some of this feedback to make WSA a better product, and we’ll continue to use that feedback to prioritize new features and improvements in the future.

Today we’d like to share more about some of the lesser-known features of WSA, as we believe these are useful tools for users of the product to understand.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Full Screen apps</strong></span></h3>
One of the top pieces of feedback we received when WSA was released last fall was to allow apps to go into “Full Screen Mode”, meaning get rid of the titlebar and taskbar giving users a more immersive experience. We listened, and we have since added that feature. When running an application inside WSA, you can use F11 to toggle it into/out of full screen mode.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Horizontal swipes</strong></span></h3>
We’ve done work to translate mouse scroll wheel events into up and down swipes. If you hold down the Shift key and use the scroll wheel, we’re able to translate that into horizontal swipes. Note, this is also how you can perform horizontal scrolling in native Windows applications.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Two Finger swipes</strong></span></h3>
We’ve seen that some applications want users to use two fingers to perform actions in the app. To simulate that in WSA, if you hold down the ALT button, and then click and drag with the mouse, we’ll send two finger touches and swipes to the application.
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Gamepad support</strong></span></h3>
Since WSA came out last October, you can use Xbox-certified gamepads with apps that support gamepad. A couple of our favorites to play with the gamepad include:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56596 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1.png" alt="Hungry Shark Evolution" width="110" height="110" />

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/hungry-shark-evolution/XP9CSV380G9FSB">Hungry Shark Evolution</a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56597 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2022/07/Picture1.jpg" alt="Talking Tom Hero Dash" width="110" height="110" />

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/talking-tom-hero-dash/XPFFTNVH8NZWR0">Talking Tom Hero Dash</a>

Thank you for all your support with WSA. Please continue to file feedback via the Feedback Hub with any issues or suggestions you might have. Together we can all make this a better product.

Thanks,

- The WSA Team]]></content:encoded>
