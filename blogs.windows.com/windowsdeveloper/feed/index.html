										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Passkeys on Windows just got easier! As part of Microsoft’s vision for a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/04/how-microsoft-can-help-you-go-passwordless-this-world-password-day/">passwordless future</a> we are working to make passkeys on Windows simple and intuitive. Passkeys are safer and easier to use than passwords, which are vulnerable to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">phishing and data breaches</a>. That is why, in support of a passwordless future, we partnered in the FIDO alliance with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">other platforms</a> in supporting passkeys. As part of our cross-industry commitment, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/26/new-security-features-in-windows-11-protect-users-and-empower-it/">launched</a> new native support for cross-device authentication and an updated experience to help users along the journey from website to platform. Continuing that journey at Authenticate 2024 we are introducing the following, which will be available in our Windows Insider channels in the coming months:
<ol>
 	<li>A plug-in model for third-party passkey providers</li>
 	<li>Enhanced native UX for passkeys</li>
 	<li>A Microsoft synced passkey provider</li>
</ol>
First, we’re excited to announce API support for third-party passkey providers to plug into the Windows 11 platform! Microsoft is partnering closely with 1Password, Bitwarden and others on integrating this capability to provide users with seamless third-party passkey provider integration into Windows 11. You will be able to use the same passkey on Windows 11 that you’ve created on your mobile device, and together we can raise the bar on login security with passkeys. To learn more join us at the Windows Security sessions at Authenticate Oct. 14-16!

Next, when creating and using passkeys, Windows 11 now has a redesigned Windows Hello experience. As a user, you can navigate to a website that supports passkeys and get prompted to select how you want to save your passkeys.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57115 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/10/Latest-update-Windows-Authenticate-Blog-Choose-passkey-1024x713.png" alt="Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a pop-up prompting the user to choose how to save their passkeys, protected with Windows Hello, with ‘Save to your Microsoft account’ and ‘Save another way’ as options." width="1024" height="713" />

<em>Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a pop-up prompting the user to choose how to save their passkeys, protected with Windows Hello, with ‘Save to your Microsoft account’ and ‘Save another way’ as options.</em>

You will be asked to complete a one-time setup with your Microsoft account, and you will be prompted to save a recovery key that will be used to verify your identity and protect your passkeys through end-to-end encryption. You can then seamlessly authenticate using your preferred sign-in method (facial recognition, fingerprint or PIN), and save your passkey with Windows Hello.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57116 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/10/Windows-Authenticate-Blog-WH-face-ID.png" alt="Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a Windows Security pop-up and Windows Hello searching for Face ID to authenticate and save the passkey." width="624" height="435" />

<em>Draft UX showing GitHub page open on Edge browser with a Windows Security pop-up and Windows Hello searching for Face ID to authenticate and save the passkey.</em><span style="font-size: min(max(16px, -0.70596px + 1rem + 0.1961vw), 20px);"> </span>

Once you have created a new passkey you can choose to save it with Windows Hello and sync it so that you can also use it on another Windows device! Just login to another Windows 11 device with your Microsoft account, complete a one-time setup, and use your synced passkeys across your Windows 11 PCs. You get a simple, seamless, login experience—all you need to do is authenticate with Windows Hello. Your passkeys are secured by end-to-end encryption and protected with the device’s TPM (Trusted Platform Module).

Microsoft is committed to making passkeys more readily available wherever you need them, with the experience, flexibility and durability that you expect when using Windows. We are excited to have you try out these new features soon!

Join us as we continue paving the way towards a passwordless future with Windows 11.
<h3>Explore the new Windows 11 security features</h3>
At Microsoft, we truly believe that security is a team sport. By partnering with OEMs, app developers and other partners in the ecosystem, and by helping people be better at protecting themselves—we are continuing to make Windows more secure by design and more secure by default. The <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMyFE">Windows Security Book</a> is available to help you learn more about what makes it easy to stay secure with Windows 11.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span data-contrast="auto">We are proud to announce that version 1.6 of the Windows App SDK is now available! Whether you’re looking for the incredible performance boost and footprint reduction of Native AOT support, enhancements for deploying your package, or quality of life improvements for controls like PipsPager and RatingControl, WinAppSDK 1.6 offers a raft of new features, performance boosts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and structural changes that enable you to make your native Windows apps better than ever before.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The Windows App SDK provides </span><span data-contrast="auto">a rich set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful and fast Windows desktop apps, including any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app. You can harness the modern controls and polish of WinUI 3, which ships as part of the WinAppSDK, or if you have an existing app that uses Win32 such as WPF, you can take advantage of only the parts of the SDK that you need. The WinAppSDK also stays up to date with frequent and OS-independent releases so your app can always access the latest innovations.</span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Get started with the Windows App SDK</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Check out the Windows App SDK </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/"><span data-contrast="none">overview</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> page to learn more about it and see how to get started. Then, if you’re ready to dive into Visual Studio and begin with your first WinUI 3 app, see our </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10"><span data-contrast="none">setup instructions</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to start developing Windows apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">New features and improvements</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT support</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">With 1.6, the Windows App SDK now supports native Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation! When publishing your app as a Native AOT app, you produce an app which has been compiled ahead of time to native code for faster startup time and a smaller memory footprint.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We’re very excited to bring the powerful capabilities of Native AOT to developers through the Windows App SDK! In our sample Contoso Camera app, we measured a 50% reduction in start time, an ~8x reduction in package size when using a framework package</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and a ~2x reduction in package size when using Windows App SDK in self-contained mode. While your results might vary, we encourage you to give Native AOT a try if it’s right for your app! </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-57101 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/09/Native-AOT-GIF.gif" alt="GIF of Bloom screensaver moving" width="1408" height="512" />

<span data-contrast="auto">For more information about Native AOT, see </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows"><span data-contrast="none">Native AOT deployment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. To get started with Native AOT in your Windows App SDK app, see our </span><a href="https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.6/1.6.0/release-notes"><span data-contrast="none">release notes for 1.6</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for what you need to know and how to set it up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Decoupled WebView2 versioning</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Instead of embedding a hard-coded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK into the Windows App SDK, we now consume the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference in 1.6. If your app uses WebView2 to display content, you can now choose a newer version of the Microsoft.Web.WebView2 package if you need to instead of the version that came with the Windows App SDK. Additionally, you can now reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK, streamlining your dependencies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">With these updates, we’ve decoupled the WinAppSDK from the Edge WebView2 API surface and brought NuGet’s sophisticated package management capabilities to the WebView2 space. Your WebView2-powered app experiences are now more versatile than ever and can tap into the newest WebView2 offerings at any time!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">New Package Deployment APIs</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">Flexible and robust package management has been a mainstay of the Windows App SDK since its inception, and with the release of 1.6 we’re only making it better. We’ve improved package management APIs with new enhancements and quality-of-life updates including package removal, provisioning and detection of pending registration and locally available updates, easy feature availability detection for light-up scenarios and more. If your app uses MSIX packaging, these enhancements are tailored to make your life easier! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">For more details, you can peruse the </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453"><span data-contrast="none">pull request here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or take a peek at </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md"><span data-contrast="none">the full spec</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> here.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Improved TabView tab tear-out</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">The WinUI 3 TabView control has received a substantial update to the tab tear-out experience in 1.6 in the form of a new CanTearOutTabs mode, overhauling how a user drags tabs out of your app in a major way. In the new mode, dragging a tab out of your app’s TabView is very similar to the tab drag experience in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome where a new window is immediately created during the drag. This allows users to visually see feedback of their action right away and it lets them drag the new window to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap it in one continuous motion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you enable the new CanTearOutTabs mode in your TabView, you won’t have to worry about any drag-and-drop API limitations because it doesn’t use them. And, you won’t have to worry about whether tearing tabs out of your app will work if the app is run as an Administrator, because that’s supported. The developer and user experiences are seamless and smooth. If your app uses TabView, you should take the new tear-out mode for a spin!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<h4 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Other control updates</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<span data-contrast="auto">While smaller in scale, in 1.6 we’ve added some polish and updates to a few other controls in WinUI 3 as well. PipsPager now supports a new mode that wraps between the first and last items:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">And finally, we’ve added a few other new APIs and features to round things out for 1.6.

<h2>Getting started with DirectML on Copilot+ PCs</h2>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
Ensure you have the correct versions of DirectML, ONNX Runtime (ORT), Windows and the minimum versioned Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU driver.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML">DirectML minimum version of 1.15.4 or greater (ARM64)  </a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML/1.18">ONNX Runtime minimum version of 1.18 (ARM64) </a></li>
 	<li>Windows 11, version 24H2 or newer</li>
 	<li>Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU Driver minimum version 1.0.0.10</li>
</ul>
<h3>Developer-Environment Set-up on Your Copilot+ PC</h3>
Let’s walk through how you can utilize DirectML and ONNX Runtime to leverage a set of models on the Copilot+ PC powered by Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU. First, you need to ensure you have the latest Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU driver package. Setting up a Qualcomm dev account is your very first step:
<ol>
 	<li>Create an account at <a href="https://qpm.qualcomm.com/">https://qpm.qualcomm.com/</a></li>
</ol>
Now, log in with your account credentials and click the following link: <a href="https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/QHND">Qualcomm Package Manager 3</a> and download the <strong>latest driver</strong> available. Then, follow the steps below to download the Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU Driver Package for Windows:
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Change OS from "Windows" to "Windows (ARM64)"</li>
 	<li>Click Download (<strong>latest driver version available</strong>)</li>
 	<li>Extract QHND.Core.1.0.0.10.Windows-ARM64.zip (or <strong>latest driver available zipped file</strong>)</li>
 	<li>Run PreAlpha_QCHexagon_NPU_Driver installer</li>
 	<li>Verify that "Neural processors &gt; Snapdragon® X Elite … NPU" has the latest driver version as specified in the release notes included in the ZIP file.</li>
</ol>
With the driver package installed and the minimum versions of DirectML, ORT and Windows enabled, try this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectML_ESRGAN">ESRGAN super-resolution model sample</a> to build a C++ application that runs on the new Copilot+ PCs!
<h3>Developers who used DirectML on their Surface device from Aug. 29 through the latest Windows Surface Hardware Update in September 2024</h3>
If you downloaded the Alpha NPU Driver Package V0.0.0.9 to test DirectML on your Copilot+ PC, recent Windows Updates may have affected the NPU functionality. To maintain DirectML functionality and NPU operational stability, please install the latest driver package V1.0.0.10 as instructed above.

Although we recommend installing the latest driver package to resolve this issue, you may choose to uninstall v0.0.0.9 Alpha Driver Package instead:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Navigate to Settings/Apps/Installed apps</li>
 	<li>Search for “Pre-Alpha Qualcomm Hexagon (NPU) Driver”</li>
 	<li>Select the “...” and click on Uninstall.</li>
 	<li>Follow the steps to remove the driver</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Current capabilities and limitations</h3>
DirectML is rapidly expanding, and we are simplifying how developers can utilize the various local accelerators, hardware variations, and frameworks across Windows. There are constraints with what is available today and they are highlighted below:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>C++ Developers need to depend on DirectML 1.15. as a redistributable package within their app (reference the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/Samples/DirectML_ESRGAN">sample</a> above)</li>
 	<li>NPU selection through the Python API for ONNX Runtime is not available currently but is coming soon!</li>
 	<li>Functionality has been verified on Surface Copilot+ PCs and limited other OEMs</li>
 	<li>There are <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/dml-ai-hub-models">specific models</a> that DirectML guarantees will work on Qualcomm® Hexagon NPU. Please leverage these exact ONNX versions during model sampling.
<ul>
 	<li>Developers will experience error code DXGI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED (0x887A0004) stating “The specified device interface or feature level is not support on this system.” when attempting to use models outside of <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/dml-ai-hub-models">supported models</a>.</li>
 	<li>For testing any models outside of our supported list, developers may enable windows developer mode (settings/systems/for developers). Models that are run in this mode may have undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

WebNN is an emerging web standard that defines how to run machine learning models in the browser and offers new possibilities for bringing AI innovations to the web. It defines how to interface with hardware acceleration APIs such as DirectML, enabling web sites to leverage the GPU or NPU on a user’s PC to run AI locally. DirectML, a key foundational component of the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/">Windows Copilot Runtime</a>, uniquely simplifies how developers can scale their AI innovations, through a single, cross-hardware DirectX API that provides a secure, consistent, performant experience across different hardware architectures. WebNN also supports integration with machine learning frameworks, like ONNX Runtime Web (ORT Web), which is part of the ONNX Runtime project. ORT Web is a JavaScript library that enables you to run ONNX models in the web browser and extends the Execution Provider (EP) framework to include WebNN as an EP.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building Windows apps that leverage on-device AI models can seem like a daunting task - there's a lot of work that goes into defining your use case, choosing and tuning the right models, and refining the logic surrounding the models.

While there's no quick and easy path to learning the ins and outs of AI on Windows, we are going to breakdown an application sample that was showcased at Build to help you see how on-device models can be leveraged to power up your applications.

The sample we will be looking at is an AI-empowered Audio Editor, built with WinUI3 and WinAppSDK. The application functionality itself is minimal, but provides a good framework to showcase the AI portion of the app.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57067 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/07/hero-1024x685.png" alt="View of the audio editor app" width="1024" height="685" />

<b>Audio Smart Trimming</b>

The Audio Editor app uses several models to enable "smart trimming" of audio, which has a flow like this:
<ol>
 	<li>User uploads an audio file that includes recognizable speech</li>
 	<li>They provide a theme keyword or phrase and a trim duration</li>
 	<li>The Audio Editor generates a trimmed audio clip that contains the most relevant segment of audio related to the provided theme</li>
</ol>
The input UI for this flow helps visualize what exactly is expected in the sample:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57069 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/07/image1-1024x685.png" alt="View of the audio editor app" width="1024" height="685" />

Once <em>Generate new clip</em> is clicked, the new audio clip is uploaded to the app and can be played for validation:

<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8">Now let’s </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8">take a look</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW83085235 BCX8"> at the models that were used to make this work.</span>

<b>Enabling Smart Trimming with Silero, Whisper, and MiniLML6v2</b>

For the "smart trimming" task, it takes three different models, all of them <a href="https://onnx.ai/onnx/">ONNX</a>, to process the input audio data into the output we are expecting. We'll break down what each model does, what it accomplishes for our use case, and where you can find more info on the models.

In order of usage:

<b>Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD)</b>

We use this model to "smart-chunk" our audio into smaller bits so that it can be processed by our transcription model.

This is necessary because Whisper (our transcription model) can only process thirty second snippets of audio at a time. We can't naively cut the audio at 30 second intervals because this would chop sentences in the middle, resulting in a transcription that didn't accurately reflect the structure and grammar of the spoken audio.

As a solution, we use Silero VAD to detect voice activity and cut on breaks in speaking, resulting in audio chunks that are small enough for Whisper to process, but are still properly sectioned portions of speech.

You can learn more about Silero VAD itself on <a href="https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/tree/master">GitHub</a>.

<strong>Whisper Tiny</strong>

After our audio has been chunked, we take the output and feed it to the Whisper Tiny model. This model transcribes speech to text and is probably the most straightforward step in our pipeline: audio chunks go in, and transcribed chunks come out.

We use the Tiny version of Whisper to optimize on performance, but it comes with some drawbacks, such as being limited to English and a possible drop off in accuracy. However, for our use case, it works great.

You can learn more about Whisper Tiny, or its variants, on <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny">HuggingFace</a>.

<strong>MiniLM</strong>

The last model we use is a text embedding model called MiniLM. MiniLM maps written sentences to a multi-dimensional vector space that encapsulates all the semantic information contained in a sentence. In other words, this model maps all the things we inherently understand about language (like meaning, grammar, vocabulary, etc.) to a numerical representation of that information. This is useful for all sorts of tasks, but we will use it for semantic search.

For this sample, we take the text transcribed from our Whisper model, our input theme phrase to search on, and use MiniLM to generate text embeddings for both. Once we have our embeddings, we can calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine Similarity</a> between our theme phrase and embedded sections of our audio text to get the most semantically similar section of our audio.

From there, we just have to cut our audio based on the timestamps, load it into the player, and that's it!

You can learn more about MiniLM on <a href="https://huggingface.co/optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">HuggingFace</a>.

<b>Running the Sample and Checking out the Code</b>

If you want to run the sample for yourself, or dive into the implementation for some more details on how this all works, head over to this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-DevRel/tree/main/Samples/AudioEditor">repository</a> where the sample lives.

We also have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-DevRel/blob/main/Samples/AudioEditor/CodeWalkthrough.md">Code Walkthrough document</a> if you want an entry point into how this sample was written.

There's quite a bit of set-up that goes into getting all the models set up in the project (since they can't be checked into source control), but all the prerequisite steps are defined in the README. Go check it out!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the latest release of Dev Home, where we’ve been working to deliver your top asks. Dev Home is available by default and is open source on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>. Let’s dive into what‘s new!
<h2>Machine configuration improvements</h2>
The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/setup">machine configuration</a> tool is intended to help you get your developer machine set up in a snap. We’ve made some improvements to it with additional <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/">WinGet DSC</a> integration. You can now generate a configuration file after going through the setup flow and Dev Home will also detect a configuration file in a repo after cloning. We’ve also added a new summary and details view when running configuration files.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57056 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/machine-config.png" alt="Machine configuration screen" width="624" height="455" data-wp-editing="1" />
<h3>Quickstart Playground</h3>
Quickstart Playground is a new experimental feature within machine configuration that allows you to quickly spin up a development project with the power of AI. To learn more about Quickstart Playground, check out our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/quickstart-playground">docs</a>.
<h2>Environments</h2>
We’re making it even easier to get into your development flows by providing access to different environment types all in one place. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/environments">environments in Dev Home</a>, you can create, connect, and configure environments such as Hyper-V virtual machines and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/">Microsoft Dev Boxes</a> all in one centralized view. Microsoft Dev Box support comes with the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mv8f79fgxtr">Dev Home Azure extension</a>.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57057 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/environments.png" alt="Environment screen" width="468" height="253" />
<h2>Windows customization</h2>
Windows customization in Dev Home grants you the ability to tweak additional settings within Windows to get a fully tailored experience. We’ve provided additional toggles for tweaking File Explorer along with Dev Drive insights. Dev Drive insights provides information on your Dev Drive volumes as well as suggestions for how to increase performance within them. The Windows customization feature is in active development and will get even more settings soon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57058 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/win-cust.png" alt="Windows customization screen" width="624" height="381" />
<h3>Quiet background processes</h3>
Within Windows customization lives an experimental feature called Quiet background processes. Running this feature will enable a session to defer some background processes, thus freeing up resources for development tools. Each session can run for up to two hours and you can see an analytic summary of CPU usage after it ends.
<h2>Utilities</h2>
Utilities in Dev Home brings additional developer tooling to Windows. With its initial release, we’ve added the top requested <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys#installing-and-running-microsoft-powertoys">PowerToys</a> tools to Windows. These are Registry Editor, Hosts File Editor, and Environment Variables editor. We’re looking to add more utilities here in the future, and if you have any you’d like to see, please file a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfjbh4?hl=en-US&gl=US">Microsoft Photos App</a> team recently released a major update, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/02/windows-photos-begins-previewing-a-windows-app-sdk-version-to-windows-insiders/">switching platforms from UWP to Windows App SDK</a>. This blog post documents our experience switching platforms, including some impactful benefits and some interesting technical challenges.

The new Photos application is already fully rolled out to Windows Insiders and is now rolling out to Retail customers starting with version 2024.11050.3002.0 and above.
<h2>Concurrent Development & Replatforming</h2>
As one of the most frequently used apps, we're continually releasing new features such as <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/03/photos-app-for-windows-11-update-brings-improvements-for-windows-insiders/">Slideshow</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/17/windows-photos-gets-background-remove-and-replace-along-with-other-improvements/">Background Removal</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/22/windows-photos-gets-generative-erase-and-recent-ai-editing-features-now-available-on-arm64-devices-and-windows-10/">Generative Erase</a>. Maintaining the ability to ship new features like these on UWP, whilst also progressing the platform switch to Windows App SDK was paramount. In simple terms, this meant all changes – both new features and Windows App SDK changes – had to go into our primary development branch. To do this with the least amount of disruption, we adopted some strategies to ensure code changes were compatible with both platforms concurrently:
<ol>
 	<li>Parallel Pull Request build validation for both UWP & Windows App SDK app variants</li>
 	<li>Conditional compilation (ifdefs) for similar but incompatible APIs</li>
 	<li>Namespace aliases for equivalent Windows:: and Microsoft:: APIs
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">#ifdef WIN_APP_SDK
namespace WUXM = winrt::Microsoft::UI::Xaml::Media;
#else
namespace WUXM = winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Media;
#endif</pre>
</li>
 	<li>Conditional inclusion of XAML source files since conditional compilation is unsupported</li>
</ol>
<h2>Processes & Integrity Level</h2>
In UWP applications, processes run at lowIL (low integrity level), also known as ‘AppContainer’, meaning <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/win32-and-com/win32-and-com-for-uwp-apps">certain APIs are restricted</a> or could require additional user confirmation prompts. In Win32 applications, including Windows App SDK, processes generally run at mediumIL (medium integrity level), meaning the app has a higher privilege level.

Using Windows App SDK, we can now save an edited file in the same folder as the original file (e.g. “foo_edited.jpg”) without requesting the user to choose the destination folder.

Due to reasons including cross-platform compatibility and privilege checking, equivalent UWP APIs such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.storagefolder.getfilesasync?view=winrt-22621">StorageFolder.GetFilesAsync</a> can be orders of magnitude slower than their corresponding Win32 APIs such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findnextfilea">FindNextFile</a>. This is especially true for file system APIs, and when dealing with large photo collections spanning 100,000+ files, the performance difference could be significant – seconds vs minutes.
<h2>PhotosService.exe</h2>
Requiring users to wait several minutes to see all their media wouldn’t be a great user experience. To achieve acceptable performance with the UWP version of the Photos App, we used a multi-process architecture including both a lowIL primary process, and a mediumIL background process “PhotosService.exe” – a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities">restricted capability</a> only available to verified publishers.

Implementing this required significant complexity:
<ol>
 	<li>Using WAP (Windows Application Packaging) to package both UWP and Win32 Applications for deployment</li>
 	<li>Adding the restricted <em>“runFullTrust”</em> capability in the AppxManifest to allow the inclusion of a mediumIL executable in the package</li>
 	<li>Building an IPC (interprocess communication) system using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes">Named Pipes</a> to allow RPC calls between two processes:</li>
</ol>
[caption id="attachment_57038" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57038 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/05/Photos_Windows_App_SDK_Blog_Post_1-1024x601.jpeg" alt="UWP Photos App Process Architecture" width="1024" height="601" /> UWP Photos App Process Architecture[/caption]

With the migration to Windows App SDK, this complex logic has been removed and integrated into a single process, dramatically simplifying our app architecture, and bringing improved performance due to the removal of interprocess communication.

One important point on the new approach is that Photos is still a multi-threaded application, and to receive File System notification events it was necessary to implement a headless window on a separate thread to isolate it from the XAML UI thread.

[caption id="attachment_57039" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-57039 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/05/Photos_Windows_App_SDK_Blog_Post_2-1024x791.jpeg" alt="Windows App SDK Photos App Process Architecture" width="1024" height="791" /> Windows App SDK Photos App Process Architecture[/caption]
<h2>WebView2</h2>
Another huge benefit of Windows App SDK is the addition of WebView2, built upon the new Chromium-based Edge browser. The Photos App uses web tech in a few places, including with our cross-platform image editor used in both OneDrive and the Photos App. Some key benefits of WebView2 include:
<ol>
 	<li>WebGL support enabling improved image rendering quality.</li>
 	<li>Superior performance when sharing high quality images between the native and web layers using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/winrt/microsoft_web_webview2_core/corewebview2sharedbuffer?view=webview2-winrt-1.0.2535.41">SharedBuffer</a>.</li>
 	<li>Supporting a more up to date version of Chromium, which carries the latest improvements and security updates.</li>
 	<li>Allowing us to optimize the performance of our AI Service which requires sending pixel buffers back and forth from our Web Editor to our Native App for AI inference.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Maintenance and Support</h2>
As an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/05/10/reimagining-the-apps-included-with-windows-11/">Inbox</a> app (included in Windows), we need to ensure Photos is running reliably for users across all supported versions of Windows. In Windows App SDK, most of the platform code is shipped as part of the WindowsAppRuntime package, in stark contrast to UWP where it’s all shipped as part of the Windows operating system.

The key difference between these two models is that users automatically get the latest platform updates to the Photos App on Windows App SDK, whereas in UWP they would have to wait for those changes to be included in Windows Update servicing patches.

In practical terms, this means we’ve often needed to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)">polyfills</a> to patch bugs, re-implement missing APIs, or even disable features entirely on older OS versions. With Windows App SDK this is no longer needed, saving precious development time and reducing the testing overhead required for different OS versions.
<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
<h3>ASTA vs STA</h3>
In UWP, the threading model was based on ASTA (Application Single-Threaded Apartment) which has a mechanism to protect the XAML UI thread against reentrancy. In contrast, Windows App SDK uses a regular STA model which requires some extra care when executing certain calls from the XAML UI thread, which could otherwise cause reentrancy and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/guides/threading#stowed-exceptions">Stowed Exceptions</a>.

For most of the cases the fix would be to re-enqueue the problematic call with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.dispatching.dispatcherqueue">DispatcherQueue</a> if it has to run in the UI thread. Another approach is to offload certain tasks to a background thread to decouple the re-entrant logic from the UI thread.
<h3>AutoPlay Support</h3>
One major feature of Photos is the ability for users to connect flash drives and mobile phone devices to import their media files. In Windows App SDK this feature has not yet been implemented, but there is a good alternative using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/autoplay2k-using">Win32 shell APIs</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop3-autoplayhandler">desktop3:AutoPlayHandler</a>.

This feature works by deploying and running a separated COM server process that handles autoplay activation and launches the Photos App’s import workflow.

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
Switching to Windows App SDK has allowed the Photos App to continue using the beautiful, cohesive, native user interface components included in WinUI, whilst adding the ability to directly call Win32 APIs and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api">maintaining compatibility</a> with the majority of UWP APIs. On the platform side, switching to Windows App SDK enables all Photos App users to receive the latest stability & performance improvements immediately, since the Windows App Runtime updates as a dependency of the Photos App package install.

Upgrading from UWP to Windows App SDK represents a larger change than previous Windows app platform updates, however the corresponding benefits significantly outweigh the development cost.

In the future we’ll be taking further advantage of Windows App SDK by having each Photos App window run in its own process – an architecture already used with overwhelming success in Chromium-based web browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Enjoy this sneak-peek of the upcoming performance improvements!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, Windows developers can leverage PyTorch to run inference on the latest models across the breadth of GPUs in the Windows ecosystem, thanks to DirectML. We’ve updated  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/torch-directml/">Torch-DirectML</a> to use DirectML 1.13 for acceleration and support PyTorch 2.2. PyTorch with DirectML simplifies the setup process, through a one-package install, making it easy to try out AI powered experiences and supporting your ability to scale AI to your customers across Windows.

To see these updates in action, check out our Build session <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/65c11f47-56d8-442b-ae52-48df62b7b542?source=sessions">Bring AI experiences to all your Windows Devices</a>.

<h2>PyTorch with DirectML is easy-to-use with the latest Generative AI models</h2>
PyTorch with DirectML provides an easy-to-use way for developers to try out the latest and greatest AI models on their Windows machine. This update builds on DirectML’s world class inferencing platform ensuring these optimizations provide a scalable and performant experience across the latest Generative AI models. Our aim in this update is to ensure a seamless experience with relevant Gen AI models, such as Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral, Phi 2, and Phi 3 Mini, and we’ll expand our coverage even more in the coming months!

The best part is using the latest Torch-DirectML package with your Windows GPU is as simple as running:
<pre>pip install torch-directml</pre>
Once installed, check out our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch/llm">language model sample</a> that will get you running a language model locally in no time! Start by installing a few requirements and logging into the Hugging Face CLI:
<pre>pip install –r requirements.txt 
huggingface-cli login</pre>
Next, run the following command, which downloads the specified Hugging Face model, optimizes it for DirectML, and runs the model in an interactive chat-based Gradio session!
<pre>python app.py --model_repo “microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct”</pre>

<em>Phi 3 Mini 4K running locally using DirectML through the Gradio Chatbot interface.</em>

These latest PyTorch with DirectML samples work across a range of machines and perform best on recent GPUs equipped with the newest drivers. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch/llm#supported-models">Supported Models</a> section of the sample for more info on the GPU memory requirements for each model.

This seamless inferencing experience is powered by our close co-engineering relationships with our hardware partners to make sure you get the most of your Windows GPU when leveraging DirectML.
<h2>Try out PyTorch with DirectML today</h2>
Trying out this update is truly as simple as running <em>“pip install torch-directml”</em> in your existing Python environment and following the instructions in one of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch#samples">our samples</a>. For more guidance on getting setup visit the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/pytorch-windows">Enable PyTorch with DirectML on Windows</a> page on Microsoft Learn.

This is only the beginning of the next chapter with DirectML and PyTorch! Stay tuned for broader use case coverage, expansion to other local accelerators, like NPUs, and more. Our goal is to meet developers where they’re at, so they can use the right tools to build the next wave of AI innovation.

We’re excited for developers to continue innovating with cutting edge Generative AI on Windows and build the AI apps of the future!]]></content:encoded>
