										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back at <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/">Build ‘23 in May</a>, we announced a host of new experiences with a renewed focus on developer productivity and performance. We are now pleased to share with you that features like Dev Home, Dev Drive, WinGet and improvements to Taskbar, File Explorer and many more will start to become generally available with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178424">latest Windows 11 update</a>. We also have exciting news to share about the developer tools you already know and love: Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Terminal.

At Build in May ’23, we announced a new home for developers on Windows – Dev Home. With the latest Windows 11 update, Dev Home is now available as part of the OS, making developer features a key component of Windows 11. Today we are excited to announce a new PC setup experience for developers.
<h3><strong>A new PC setup experience for developers on Windows 11</strong></h3>
For the first time in Windows, you will be able to identify as a developer during your initial PC setup and Windows will customize your install experience catering to your workloads. To do this, select the "Development" intent on the "Let's customize your experience" page during setup. Once you set up your PC with “Development” intent it is easier to get all the benefits of Dev Home.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56856 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Developer-Intent_hi-res-1024x576.png" alt="Development intent screen" width="1024" height="576" />
<h3><strong>Dev Home: Your productivity companion</strong></h3>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home</a> is a new experience for developers in Windows 11 that helps you get back in the zone and streamlines your workflows, boosting your productivity. Dev Home assists you in setting up your dev environment by downloading apps, packages, or repositories, and lets you connect to your developer accounts and tools (such as GitHub). It also helps you create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/">Dev Drive</a> for performant storage - all in one place. Dev Home also provides a customizable dashboard to help you monitor both your system and dev projects. We are releasing Dev Home v0.5 alongside the latest Windows 11 update to provide even more functionality like managing your extensions. We are adding a new extensions page on Dev Home, available now, that helps you discover and manage your Dev Home extensions, giving you the control to enhance and personalize your experience. With this addition, the Dev Home GitHub Extension will no longer be automatically installed. For more information see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home/">Dev Home for Windows Developers | Microsoft Learn.</a>
<h3><strong>Unattended and reliable dev machine setup: Reducing set up time from days to hours</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced WinGet Configuration, a fast and reliable mechanism to help developers get ready to code in just a few clicks. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/configuration/">WinGet Configuration</a> is now stable and no longer requires enabling experimental features. To help you get started we have several <a href="https://aka.ms/dsc.yaml">samples</a> that you can try, and several GitHub repos now include configuration files to help you quickly install the tools to build the source code.  For example:

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">vscode/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/vscode (github.com)</a>

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml">PowerToys/.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml at main · microsoft/PowerToys (github.com)</a>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56854 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Configure.jpg" alt="WinGet Configuration code" width="994" height="562" />

WinGet 1.6 makes its debut with several exciting new capabilities. Support for dependencies is now available. Packages that were previously blocked from submission can now be added to our catalog.

WinGet 1.6 introduces the new `winget download` command which allows you to download installers. This feature enables IT professionals to access packages from the community repository and make them available to their enterprise customers.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56855 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Download.jpg" alt="WinGet download code" width="994" height="562" />

Support for free Apps rated “e” for everyone from the Microsoft Store with licenses is coming in a future release.

A new Group Policy enables IT professionals to determine if their users can make use of the Windows Package Manager through either the CLI or PowerShell cmdlets. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases">The latest release of the WinGetCLI</a> contains the updated ADMX files. For more information on using winget, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">Use the winget tool to install and manage applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.
<h3><strong>Dev Drive: A new storage volume tailor-made for developers: supercharged for performance and security</strong></h3>
At Build we introduced Dev Drive – a new type of storage volume, tailor-made for developers, with a file system that delivers both performance and security. Starting today, Dev Drive will be available for all developers on Windows with the latest Windows 11 update.

Dev Drive is based on the Resilient File System (ReFS), which, combined with a new performance mode capability in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus, offers up to 30% file system improvement in build times for file I/O scenarios. To reap the benefits of Dev Drive, we recommend moving your package caches and repositories to Dev Drive(s). <a href="https://aka.ms/devdrive">Learn more</a>.

In addition, to quickly view the status of your Dev Drive volumes, the “For Developers settings page” now has a new Dev Drive section. The section also provides deep links to Disk &amp; Volume settings to create a Dev Drive and launch the Windows Security app to control antivirus behavior.
<h3><strong>Performance mode for Microsoft Defender </strong></h3>
Microsoft Defender Antivirus has released performance mode that provides asynchronous scanning on Dev Drive volumes. Behavior can be controlled via the new improved UI for Dev Drive <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">  </span> in the Microsoft Security app under “Virus &amp; threat protection”. If you have multiple Dev Drives, you can now quickly identify which one is in “Performance mode”.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56849 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_02-1024x900.png" alt="Virus and threat protection settings" width="1024" height="900" />

Upon clicking on “See volumes”, you can view all your Dev Drives. In this example below, we have two Dev Drives; (D:\) and (F:\) are both formatted in ReFS but Defender Performance Mode has been enabled only on (F:\).

<strong> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-56848 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/Defender_Performance_Mode_03-1024x407.png" alt="Dev Drive protection screen" width="1024" height="407" /></strong>
<h3><strong>Reducing toil and unlocking the fun and joy of developing on Windows with new improvements</strong></h3>
The team has listened closely to what is top of mind for you, including improvements to the Taskbar that we announced at Build back in May. Starting today, all these improvements will become available in the stable version with the latest Windows 11 update.
<ol>
 	<li>You can now quickly identify and access any instance of each app housed in the taskbar with just one click. All instances of the app are ungrouped with labels on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can now hide your Time and Date with a setting on the taskbar.</li>
 	<li>You can quickly and easily shut down applications with a simple right-click on the app directly from the taskbar without opening the Task Manager. This setting can be enabled within the Developer settings page to then have “End task” appear within the context menu when you right-click on the icon within taskbar.</li>
 	<li>For Developers settings page has moved from “Privacy &amp; Security” to System. This provides a quick and easily discoverable entry point to developer settings.</li>
 	<li>You can now get improved performance of archive functionality during compression on Windows. We have added native support for additional archive formats, including tar, 7-zip, rar, gz and many others using the libarchive open-source project.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>File Explorer is getting even better </strong></h3>
We have introduced new functionality and collection control in WinUI3. ItemsView collection control offers LinedFlowLayout and Island functionality provides an easy way to adopt WinUI3 look and feel in any part of your app without having to change your entire application. File Explorer now runs on WinUI3 and has introduced several new features like Gallery powered by ItemsView and Island functionality, making it easy to access your photo collection. You can also now bring these new WinUI3 capabilities to your apps and offer a rich user experience to your customers.

In addition, we have also added multi-threading capabilities to File Explorer to greatly improve the performance of copy, move, recycle, and delete actions. Large operations should see significant improvements in the calculating phase as well as the actual file operation. As noted in our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/26/delivering-delightful-performance-for-more-than-one-billion-users-worldwide/">May 2023 blog</a>, these changes show over 40% improvements in bulk delete operations, giving time back to developers.
<h2><strong>Tools you know and love are getting even better and smarter </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>New and exciting – Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input and Web Search features are coming to Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview</strong></h3>
With the Windows Terminal 1.19 Preview we are introducing several new features such as the Suggestions UI, Broadcast Input, and Web Search. The Suggestions UI is a new UI element in Windows Terminal that provides text suggestions to the user. These suggestions can come from recently run commands, saved commands, and more.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56853 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/SuggestionsUI.gif" alt="Suggestions user experience" width="994" height="589" />

Broadcast Input allows users to broadcast their input from one Terminal pane to another Terminal pane in real time. Broadcast Input was a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2634">popular feature request</a> from our community members, and we are thrilled to delight our developers with this exciting feature.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56851 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/BroadcastInput.gif" alt="Broadcast input experience" width="1338" height="717" />

Web Search was a community contribution. When the right-click context menu is enabled, users will have a new option to do a web search on highlighted text. Web Search will default to Bing, and we are providing control to developers to change the default to the search engine of their choice.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-56852 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/09/WebSearch.gif" alt="Web Search user experience" width="1914" height="560" data-wp-editing="1" />
<h3><strong>Introducing experimental features in Windows Terminal Canary</strong></h3>
Windows Terminal is distributed in a variety of formats. We are thrilled to announce that we are adding Windows Terminal Canary to the Windows Terminal family. Windows Terminal Canary is a new canary build of Windows Terminal that includes “hot off the presses” experimental features (including our AI chat feature).

New builds of Windows Terminal Canary are available nightly. This is the least stable channel of Windows Terminal, so you may be the first to discover bugs that no one else has before. If you are eager for the latest bits, then this is the build for you!
<h3><strong>New experimental features in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - Auto Memory reclaim, new networking mode and more</strong></h3>
The <a href="http://www.github.com/microsoft/wsl/releases">latest release of WSL</a> brings access to new experimental features and some important quality and bug fixes! We’ve added new experimental features that you <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">can opt-in to using</a>, so you can get early access to WSL improvements that we are investigating making default in the future. This includes having the WSL VM automatically shrink in memory size when you’re not using it, setting your WSL virtual hard disks to be sparse so they will automatically shrink in disk size and conserve your disk space, as well as Hyper-V firewall which allows your Windows firewall rules to affect your WSL distros, and an entirely new networking mode that improves network compatibility, adds IPv6 support and more! Additionally, there are other bug fixes such as you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/9231">now run WSL in session 0,</a> WSL GUI apps have Windows snapping support with the keyboard, and more! To see a full list of WSL changes please <a href="https://aka.ms/wslsep2023updateblogpost">see this blog post</a>.

We continue to invest in driving developer productivity, convenience and performance with every update, and we are excited to share these features and experiences with you. To learn more and keep up to date with the latest news please visit <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Windows Dev Center</a>.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Windows PCs require a restart to apply each month’s security updates. Today we’re offering tips and best practices that can help you make sure your applications seamlessly resume after a restart and keep your app users happy.

Some users manage Windows updates (and restarts) for themselves. Others prefer that their PCs automatically restart when not in use. In either case, users typically prefer to find their applications exactly as they left them after an update. Their flow on Windows is more productive and fun when apps restore their state, position and pending operations following an update.

What does this mean for you as an application developer? If your app is documentation-focused, you might want to help people remember where in the document they were editing most recently. If your app helps people modify images, consider saving their “undo” stack and/or creating a temporary copy of their workspace. For game developers, it might be helpful to implement a quick “save” and ask players where they would like to resume. Ultimately, your apps can offer seamless continuity following a restart – for updates or otherwise – by following a few best practices:
<ul>
 	<li>Save the user’s state.</li>
 	<li>Remember how their previous views were positioned.</li>
 	<li>Relaunch the app following the update.</li>
</ul>
In this post, we will explore native APIs you can use to help you save an app user’s work and resume an app state following a restart.
<h2>Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps</h2>
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) provides <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle">lifecycle management capabilities</a> to applications. While a UWP app doesn’t need anything special to be restarted and resumed after a system update, it is recommended to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/app-lifecycle#save-your-state">save the app state<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span></a> periodically.
<h2>Win32 apps</h2>
If you are developing a Windows desktop app, you can use the Application Recovery and Restart (ARR) APIs to register your app for restart. Specifically, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">registering for restart</a> helps applications cleanly close upon system restart and relaunch after restart with pre-defined arguments.

Whether you are building Win32 apps or you’re using Windows app SDK, you can find <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cpp-winui-packaged">ARR API usage samples on GitHub</a>.

In addition to registering apps for restart, you should consider how an app can best resume its previous workload and recover the previous state. Common strategies include saving often to disk and providing context to resume state in the arguments used when registering via ARR API. Here is a code example:
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">// Register for restart with the current value of app text box

RegisterApplicationRestart(counterTextBlock().Text().c_str(), 0);

// Update registration before crash with the new value of the app counter text box

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK([](PVOID recoveryData){


     BOOL canceled;

     if (SUCCEEDED(ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(&amp;canceled)) &amp;&amp; !canceled)

     {

          const auto counter = static_cast&lt;uint32_t*&gt;(recoveryData);

          RegisterApplicationRestart(to_hstring(*counter).c_str(), 0);
     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return (DWORD)0;

     }), &amp;_counter, RECOVERY_DEFAULT_PING_INTERVAL, 0);</pre>
<h2>.NET apps</h2>
Similar to Win32 apps, .NET apps can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/recovery/registering-for-application-restart">register</a> for restart by using the ARR APIs. The only difference is using <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32">p/Invoke</a> to wrap the native API calls. You can find .NET sample code using ARR APIs <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/RestartRegistration/cs-winui-packaged">on GitHub</a>.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

// Best effort to register recovery callback to update restart arguments with the latest seconds counter value.

RegisterApplicationRecoveryCallback(new APPLICATION_RECOVERY_CALLBACK(p =&gt;

{

     ApplicationRecoveryInProgress(out BOOL canceled);

     if (!canceled)

     {

          RegisterApplicationRestart(_counter.ToString(), 0);

     }

     ApplicationRecoveryFinished(true);

     return 0;

}), null, 5000, 0);</pre>
Apps with critical workloads can use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate">power APIs</a> to keep the system running and prevent a restart, but this isn’t permanent. Both users and administrators need devices to stay secure and a system will eventually be forced to restart after an update. Further, keeping the system powered on can drain battery or use excess power.

We encourage you to read more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate#remarks">how to effectively use Power APIs</a> for system services and long-running critical applications.
<h2>Share your feedback</h2>
Have suggestions or ideas for API improvement? Still have questions about how your app and Windows Update can work together? Please share your thoughts by submitting them via Feedback Hub (Windows key + F)!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce the public preview launch of Win32 app isolation. This blog post provides an overview of the topic. To learn more about the developer experience and engage with the team, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

It is worth noting that Win32 app isolation is an addition to the family of existing Windows sandbox options, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox</a> and<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview"> Microsoft Defender Application Guard</a>. While these options are based on virtualization based security, Win32 app isolation is built on the foundation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> (and more). <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainers</a> are specifically designed to encapsulate and restrict the execution of processes, helping to ensure they operate with limited privileges, commonly referred to as low integrity levels.
<h3>Win32 App isolation</h3>
The frequency and impact of zero-day vulnerabilities have witnessed a substantial increase over the years. Attackers frequently focus their attention on popular applications, exploiting either unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities. That's why we strongly advocate for the integration of preventive and containment measures.

To this end, we propose using the combined power of Win32 app isolation and cutting-edge technologies like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/smart-app-control/overview">Smart App Control</a>, which together work to effectively block untrusted applications and limit damage if trusted apps are compromised. By implementing this approach, a robust security strategy can be established, significantly mitigating the potential harm caused by zero-day attacks.

Win32 app isolation is a new security feature designed to be the default isolation standard on Windows clients. It is built on<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer"> AppContainers</a> and offers several added security features to help windows platform defend against attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in the application (this could be 3P libraries as well). To isolate their apps, application developers can update their applications using the tools provided by Microsoft. For more information on Win32 app Isolation developer experience, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation">GitHub page</a>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56813 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure1-LayeredApproach-1024x545.png" alt="Diagram showing how preventive and containment strategies can be applied." width="1024" height="545" />

<em>Figure 1: Combining Preventive and Containment Strategies.</em>

Another benefit of isolation is to safeguard end-user privacy choices in the event of a breach. When a Win32 app runs with the same privilege as the user, it is possible to allow itself access to user’s information without the user's consent. Consequently, there is a risk of unauthorized access to the user's privacy data by malicious actors without their knowledge or consent.
<h3>Goals of Win32 app isolation</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-56814 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure2-Objectives-1024x449.png" alt="Diagram showing goals of Win32 app isolation" width="1024" height="449" />

<em>Figure 2: Key objectives of Win32 app isolation</em>

<strong>Limit damage</strong>: Win32 app isolation achieves its goal of limiting impact (in the event apps are compromised) by running apps with low privilege, which requires a multi-step attack to break out of the container. Attackers must target a specific capability or vulnerability, compared to having broad access and since the attack must be directed at a specific vulnerability, mitigation patches can be quickly applied, reducing the shelf life of the attack.

<strong>Reduce developer effort</strong>: To reduce the effort required for developers to update their apps, Microsoft provides developer tools and experiences, with a focus on the MSIX packaging tool and the Application Capability Profiler.

<strong>Seamless user experience</strong>: Finally, while the focus is on security, it is critical that security decisions are not delegated to end-users via cryptic security prompts, and application compatibility is maintained.
<h3>Limit damage</h3>
The protection offered by Win32 App isolation follows a two-step process. In the first step, the Win32 application is launched as a low integrity process using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>, which is recognized as a security boundary by Microsoft. Consequently, the process is limited to a specific set of Windows APIs by default and is unable to inject code into any process operating at a higher integrity level.

In the second step, the least privilege is enforced by granting authorized access to Windows securable objects. This access is determined by capabilities that are added to the application manifest through MSIX packaging. Securable objects in this context refer to Windows resources whose access is safeguarded by capabilities. These capabilities serve as a means to implement a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists">Discretionary Access Control List </a>on Windows.
<h3>Reduce developer effort</h3>
To help ensure that isolated applications run smoothly, developers must define the access requirements for the application via access capability declarations in the application package manifest.

The Application Capability Profiler <strong>(ACP</strong>) simplifies the entire process by allowing the application to run in "learn-mode" with low privileges. Instead of failing access if the capability is not present, ACP allows access <strong>and logs additional capabilities required for access if the application were to run isolated</strong>.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56815" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure3-Overview-of-ACP-1024x340.png" alt="Diagram showing the different steps involved in profiling your Win32 app" width="1024" height="340" />

<em>Figure 3: Overview of Application Capability Profiler</em>

Under the hood, <strong>ACP</strong> uses the Windows Performance Analyzer data layer backend (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer">WPA</a>) and parses Event Trace Logs (<strong>ETL</strong>) to provide a list of additional capabilities needed. ETLs are detailed and verbose, and ACP parses them to output missing capabilities as a file. Once the capabilities are output, they can simply be included in the application package manifest.

Finally, ACP provides a WPA profile file “<em>ACP-StackTrace.wpaProfile”</em> that allows the user to easily configure WPA to inspect the event trace logs captured (in learn-mode) for relevant call stack information. In most cases, call stack analysis using WPA is not required.

For more information on <strong>ACP</strong>, please refer to the Github documentation page, linked <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/blob/main/docs/profiler/application-capability-profiler.md#stack-tracing---acp-stacktracewpaprofile">here</a>.
<h3>Seamless user experience</h3>
To create a smooth user experience that aligns with non-isolated/native Win32 applications, two key factors should be taken into consideration, as outlined below. The first factor relates to implementing methods to manage access to files and privacy information within and outside the isolation boundary (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a>). The second factor involves integrating Win32 apps with other Windows interfaces in a way that helps enable seamless functionality without causing perplexing user consent prompts. Now, let's explore these factors in greater detail:
<ol>
 	<li>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information;</li>
 	<li>Integrating Win32 Apps for compatibility with other Windows interfaces;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approaches for accessing data and privacy information.</h3>
Access to a user's private data, such as camera, microphone, location, images, files, or folders, is not permitted without the user's permission. However, the app may require access to certain program files, such as .NET libraries or protected registry keys. Asking for permission to access user folders is intuitive, but asking for permission to access program files and registry keys can be confusing for users. This confusion can be exploited by a compromised Win32 app to trick the user into allowing access to a registry key or sensitive file, which can then be used to escape the sandbox.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56816" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Figure4-Managing-User-Consent-1024x484.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods to reduce unnecessary prompts presented to user" width="1024" height="484" />

<em>Figure 4: Effectively managing user consents.</em>

To help prevent unauthorized access, several instrumentations have been built. Win32 apps need to explicitly include the “<em>isolatedWin32-promptForAccess</em>” capability and declare their intent to support prompting. Apps that do not require access to user's data outside the app can opt out of any kind of user prompting for consent. Note, this capability only allows control over filesystem access, access to privacy related information such as camera, location and microphone shall always prompt.

Let us now discuss approaches on how user consents are obtained. User prompts are displayed when user consent is required, and the context of the prompt should be meaningful to the end user, such as accessing the user's documents or camera. The other way to grant consent to files is via user selection such as when the user selects a file via the file dialog or by right clicking the context menu.

When the user grants consent to a specific file for the isolated application, the isolated application interfaces with Windows <strong>Brokering File System</strong> (BFS) and grants access to the files via a mini filter driver. BFS simply opens the file and serves as the interface between the isolated application and BFS.

File and registry virtualization helps ensure that apps continue to work while not updating the base file or registry. This also minimizes any user experience friction while maintaining application compatibility. Protected namespaces are created to allow access only to the app and do not require user consent. For example, access to a folder that has a property only known to the Win32 app and required for app compatibility can be granted.
<h3>Integrations with Win32 app isolation for compatibility</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-56817" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Picture5-MaintainingAppCompat-1024x509.png" alt="Diagram showing various methods applied to maintain app compatibility." width="1024" height="509" />

<em>Figure 5: Maintaining app compatibility with isolation.</em>

In order to achieve a high level of similarity and feature parity between isolated and non-isolated Win32 applications, certain allowances have been made. Specifically, Win32 apps operating with low privileges (referred to as low integrity level) are permitted to interact with file systems and various APIs. For example, interactions involving File Type Associations, including the "open with" option, COM servers, and file drag and drop, are facilitated through BFS (File System Broker).

Furthermore, capabilities included in the application manifest enable interactions with other Windows components, such as shell notifications and system tray icons. This ensures that these functionalities can be utilized without compromising the security of these applications.
<h3>What’s Next!</h3>
To summarize, Win32 app isolation enhances security for Windows clients by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer">AppContainer</a> and additional security controls (as described above) to help reduce the risk of damage from compromised applications and help safeguard user privacy. The approach enforces least privilege through added capabilities and employs various strategies to help prevent unauthorized access, while minimizing developer effort and maintaining application compatibility.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to introduce Dev Drive! A new storage volume optimized for developer workloads that delivers performance, security, and control. Dev Drive is built on the Resilient File System (ReFS) and combined with the new performance mode capability of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, provides up to 30% better performance for overall build times compared to current, in-market Windows 11 (22H2).
<h3><strong>Performance and Security </strong></h3>
We received feedback from developers that slow file io performance was disruptive to their workflow. In response, we analyzed the file system to understand where the bottlenecks were. Benchmarks were created across multiple end-to-end developer scenarios and across multiple languages. We then made optimizations to the file system and introduced a new performance capability for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Now available in public preview, this new capability provides asynchronous scanning on a Dev Drive and does not change the security posture of your system drive or other drives  Asynchronous scanning provides improved security compared to traditional folder and process exclusions which are often used by developers. As a result, Dev Drive improves overall build performance, most notably in heavy file io based scenarios. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-antivirus-performance-mode?view=o365-worldwide">Protecting Dev Drive using performance mode</a>.
<h3><strong>Control</strong></h3>
Beyond simply providing faster performance, the purpose of Dev Drive is to give control back to you, the developer. While there are specific configurations that Microsoft generally recommends, and have used as defaults, we have also created tools for you to further customize it. For example, administrators on the device can modify the behavior of filter manager to allow which filters are attached. You may wish to use additional filter drivers for app compat reasons, or if you have a different security posture, you can gain more performance by removing filters.

<strong>Including new, easier UX</strong>

Previously the “Disk Management” tool was used to set up and maintain disks. Now we have the same functionality with the modern Settings app. You can do everything you need to do to create a Dev Drive, including creating a new volume, creating & attaching a VHD, shrinking or expanding disk sizes, and creating partitions, all in one place.

Here is the new Disks & Volumes UI to support creating a Dev Drive and VHD scenarios.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56806 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-05-30-135009.png" alt="" width="691" height="273" />

<strong>Guidance</strong>

<strong> </strong>We recommend placing your working directories, repositories, and package caches on a <a href="http://aka.ms/devdrive">Dev Drive</a>. We are working with partners to fully take advantage of Dev Drive by default, see our partner blogs for <a href="https://aka.ms/vsdevdrive">Visual Studio and Dev Box</a> along with other features such as <a href="https://aka.ms/EngMSDevDrive">Copy on Write.</a> And our own documentation at aka.ms/devdrive for full configuration guidance.

Since Dev Drive only enables a minimal set of filter drivers, any applications or features that depend on those filters will not work on a Dev Drive. For that reason we do not support all apps being installed on a Dev Drive. Developers should test their scenarios, and if needed, enable additional filters or keep their tools installed on another drive.
<h3><strong>Benchmarks</strong></h3>
<strong>How we tested</strong>

Our testing plan while creating Dev Drive was two-fold:
<ol>
 	<li>Build out automatic performance tests that would run on a build-by-build cadence</li>
 	<li>Test and profile our end-to-end scenarios regularly</li>
</ol>
We added automatic performance tests to our build labs to ensure that we had measurements tracking our performance for each build. We used the full git suite (clone, commit, etc.) in the lab. These tests enabled us to watch the progression of git clone performance, for example, build over build. Not only were we watching to ensure the speed of a single git clone operation was trending down, but we were also watching to see if any regressions were checked in by the development team for Dev Drive, or other feature teams working on similar components of the Windows OS.

<strong>Validation and investigation testing</strong>

To further test, validate and profile key developer workloads we’ve built a set of synthetic benchmarks which cover various workloads like Python, Node, .NET, and Java. We’ve worked with the Storage & File Systems and Defender teams to take traces, validate the improvements and find opportunities for further refinement to the file system and Defender.

For these tests we created a consistent hardware setup using a Surface Laptop 4 to compare the default Windows 11 22H2 configuration with Defender enabled, against the latest builds with Dev Drive. We used common public repos and basic scenarios, a few of which are:
<ul>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore">Orchard Core</a> project using .NET</li>
 	<li>Run <a href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/tests">django tests</a></li>
 	<li>Build <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework">Spring Framework</a> project using Gradle</li>
 	<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node</a> repo using Git</li>
</ul>
<strong>Results</strong>

<strong> </strong>As you can see, every scenario benefits differently from the optimizations. Scenarios that are more file io heavy benefit the most from Dev Drive.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56805 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-05-30-121342-1024x573.png" alt="" width="1024" height="573" />
<h3><strong>Welcome to the Journey!</strong></h3>
This is just the start of improvements to come. The Windows ecosystem consists of a wide variety of hardware configurations, with each configuration comes varied performance results. We invite you to help us test Dev Drive to ensure the product is impactful for the scenarios that matter most to you. Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us. We are excited for you to try out your developer scenarios on your hardware configuration and leave us feedback through Feedback Hub under the Dev Drive context.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the team that brought you Windows Terminal, Windows Subsystem for Linux, PowerToys and Windows Package Manager (WinGet), we are excited to introduce Dev Home, a new open-source experience in Windows created just for developers. Dev Home is a centralized location for setting up your machine, monitoring your system information, and managing your projects.

Dev Home is part of Windows and will update through the Microsoft Store and GitHub with continuous releases to add new features and improve quality. Today, you can install Dev Home (Preview) from the <a href="https://aka.ms/devhome">Microsoft Store</a> or from the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.
<h1>Dev Home at its core</h1>
Dev Home is designed with customization and configurability in mind. It's built as an open-source tool with an extension model to allow you to create your own customized Dev Home experience. Our team is striving to make Dev Home a great place for all developers and its extensibility can help make it tailored just for you.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56792 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/welcome-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />
<h1>Extensions</h1>
Extensions can provide their own experiences within the Dev Home and also provide widgets for the dashboard. If you'd like to learn how to create an extension for Dev Home, check out our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/blob/main/docs/extensions.md">docs</a>. In the future, we're looking to create a marketplace within Dev Home, to make finding and installing extensions that much easier. We welcome everyone and want to collaborate on how we can make Dev Home the best location for everyone.
<h2>Dev Home GitHub Extension</h2>
Dev Home comes with one extension installed by default: the <a href="https://aka.ms/devhomegithubextension">Dev Home GitHub extension</a>. This extension is also open source and has its own <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhomegithubextension">GitHub repo</a>. The Dev Home GitHub extension connects your GitHub account to Dev Home to provide GitHub integration right onto your desktop. This extension provides GitHub widgets for the Dev Home dashboard and repo suggestions for the machine configuration tool.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56793 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/github-setup-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />

To further enhance the extension ecosystem, we’re actively working on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/521">creating an Azure DevOps (ADO) extension</a> to provide similar functionality to the GitHub extension and give you even more control over your ADO projects. We are also pairing with Team Xbox to bring the public Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) to Dev Home to help you find many of the tools you need to set up a game development environment.
<h1>Machine configuration using Dev Home</h1>
One of the biggest pain points we've heard from developers is the time and hassle it takes to set up a dev environment to code for an existing project. We've included a new environment configuration tool to help make it easy to set up your local machine as well as a remote environment like a Dev Box or GitHub Codespaces.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56794 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/machine-config-1024x653.png" alt="" width="1024" height="653" />
<h2>End-to-end setup</h2>
One way to get set up using Dev Home is through the end-to-end setup flow. This flow allows you to choose repositories to clone from your GitHub account or you can simply enter a URL. At this point in the flow, you can also choose to create a Dev Drive to clone your repositories to. After choosing repositories to clone, you can select applications to install. This page is powered by WinGet and acts as a GUI to help you install all the packages you need. Once you've chosen your repos and applications to install, you can click set up, and let Dev Home handle the rest for getting your machine ready for development.
<h2>WinGet configuration</h2>
Another option you can use for setting up your machine is WinGet’s new DSC configuration YAML files. These files can install applications, configure them, and more to help you achieve the desired state for your development environment. Dev Home provides the option to run these configuration files and see their output all within the setup tool. <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">To learn more about WinGet </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">configuration files, check out this </span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/winget-configuration-preview/"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">blog post</span></a><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">.</span>
<h1>Dashboard and widgets</h1>
Dev Home includes a customizable dashboard with developer-focused widgets built using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/widgets/">Windows widget platform</a>. Widgets we've shipped with this first release of Dev Home include system resource widgets with information based on your CPU, GPU, network, and memory usage. Additionally, the Dev Home GitHub extension provides GitHub widgets to display issue and pull request information based on a repository, plus issues and pull requests you've been mentioned in, assigned to, or have your review requested on. If you have more widgets you'd like to see, please file a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56795 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/dashboard.png" alt="" width="2496" height="1592" />
<h1>Creating Dev Drives using Dev Home</h1>
Dev Home makes it easy to set up Dev Drives when using the machine configuration tool. Dev Drives are a new storage volume option we've released to the Windows Insider Program for Microsoft Build. These drives use the Resilient File System, or ReFS, and they also run performance mode for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These modifications allow for up to a 30% performance improvement in file intensive scenarios like builds and package manager activities.
<h1>Dev Home and Windows</h1>
We are working to ensure Dev Home and Windows are integrated together seamlessly. Using the Windows Insiders Program, we will be exploring different ways to bring you the Dev Home experience. As part of Windows OOBE (out of box experience), you can now select “Development” as an option for how you plan to use your device. We will experiment with different experiences such as recommending Dev Home in Start to help you finish getting your machine into a code-ready state. To learn more about Dev Drive, check out <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/06/01/dev-drive-performance-security-and-control-for-developers/">this blog post</a>!
<h1>Let's enjoy the ride</h1>
We are so excited to have you on this journey with us to make Dev Home a great place for developers. If you want to learn more about Dev Home, feel free to check out our <a href="https://aka.ms/devhomedocs">docs site</a>. If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, feel free to file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>. If you have any questions or want to provide feedback, feel free to reach out to Kayla (<a href="https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft">@cinnamon_msft</a>) on Twitter. We hope you enjoy our very first release of Dev Home and we look forward to seeing you at our next one!]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past year, we have made major strides in improving fundamentals across Windows.  From enhancing Windows’ speed and reliability to optimizing the performance of its flagship applications to improving Window’s sustainability, we have been working diligently to deliver faster, more reliable, and more efficient computing experiences that our users love.

Among the highlights from the last year:
<ul>
 	<li>We improved frequently used shell interactions like Taskbar, Notifications, and Quick Settings by as much as 15%!</li>
 	<li>Getting users into productivity faster by improving the time it takes to get to the desktop by 10% and reducing the impact of startup apps by over 50%.</li>
 	<li>Making PCs more sustainable with our new Energy Recommendations and Carbon-Aware Windows Update. We see a 6% average reduction in energy consumption for the users who use the recommended energy settings</li>
 	<li>Windows 11 is the most reliable version of Windows ever, with recent updates continuing to improve reliability.</li>
 	<li>Microsoft Edge starts up faster than ever before and saves memory with features like Sleeping Tabs, which saves up to 83% of memory for background tabs.</li>
 	<li>The new Teams app for Windows is 2x faster while using half the resources.</li>
</ul>
Today, we’re going to give you a behind-the-scenes peek into how performance improvements are delivered!  Windows operates at a massive scale – with over one billion users and a rich PC ecosystem, and there are innumerable combinations of usage patterns, key apps, and hardware.  Windows is foundational to many products too, each with varying needs – it powers your PC, it is the host OS for Azure, and it is core to Xbox and HoloLens.  With Windows 11, we are also releasing more frequently, increasing the need to protect against regressions and shortening our cycle for driving improvements.  Thankfully, we have built infrastructure and tools that help us find, understand, and fix performance problems at the massive scale Windows operates at.
<h3>Delivering Performance at Scale</h3>
If you go back 10 years ago, life as a performance analyst in Windows was challenging!  We would develop an operating system for months before it was released to external users as a beta release, and then we responded to bugs that were filed by our users and partners.  When you received a bug indicating users had performance issues in some scenarios, we did not always have the information necessary to root cause the bug.  Reproducing the issue was often a challenge.  Once you have found and understood the issue, how do you know how common it is?  As you can imagine, this process was slow and cumbersome.  Fast forward to today, when it’s hard to even remember those days.

Today we have a richer, more comprehensive story to guarantee great performance.  It starts during the design phase, where teams define strong performance goals to ensure our products meet the needs of our users.  Significant research has gone into users’ expectations, and we rely on that research to guide our goal-setting for user interactions.  We call these “interaction classes”, and they help us set targets and ensure we have the right UX affordances for experiences, whether they’re a nearly instant interaction like opening the Start Menu or longer like deleting files.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56778 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-1-Interaction-Classes.png" alt="" width="967" height="354" />

During development, we protect performance with daily performance gates that measure key Windows performance indicators ranging from Windows UX experiences, application experiences, resume from standby/sleep, memory and storage, and more.  Every day, we run over one million machine hours of validation.  This helps protect our daily build quality and ensures that teams can be productive.  Once we complete selfhost and evaluate our performance measures on our own devices, we flight builds to our vibrant Windows Insider community who provides us rich feedback on quality issues they observe across a breadth of device configurations and use cases.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56779 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-2-By-the-numbers.png" alt="" width="975" height="345" />

<em><strong>Diagnostic data by the numbers: (1) Over 2.5 million cabs per day; (2) over 12 million performance traces per year; (3) over 70.4 billion scenario performance data points per year.</strong> </em>

The scale of feedback we receive, both through feedback and perf diagnostic data, is massive.  Over the past few years we have invested in capturing performance and other Windows quality measures via diagnostic data in addition to backend services to analyze the information we get and to identify issues.  For important scenarios, we can now see the distribution of the real-world performance observed by our users across our broad ecosystem of devices.  Performance is a spectrum, not one number, and what you experience on your system may be quite different from another user with different hardware, running different apps, and using their system differently.  Another key innovation for us is the ability to analyze traces at scale and find issues that are on the critical path of a scenario’s responsiveness. This is a rich tool that allows us to tease apart what is causing performance issues in traces – ranging from scenario-specific code, IO delays, all the way down to kernel level scheduling optimizations and even driver quality issues.
<h3>Deploying These Techniques to Ensure Delightful Experiences</h3>
<strong>Delivering a great Instant On experience (Resume from Modern Standby with Windows Hello)</strong>

With Windows 11, you can get back to productivity more quickly than ever with Windows Hello and Instant On.  Most laptops today use Modern Standby and Windows Hello to offer a password-less logon experience.  Our goal is to get you back to productivity in seconds, and our latest generation of Surface PCs, like the Surface Laptop 5 and Surface Pro 9 are 10% faster than the prior generations.  We were able to achieve this with performance improvements in silicon, camera drivers, display drivers, and the OS over the last few releases.

A responsive, fluid, and fast Windows experience requires great baseline performance <strong><em>and</em></strong> the ability to deliver that consistently.  The negative performance feedback we receive for Windows Hello is infrequent, but when it occurs, it is often due to longer times to unlock your device.  Here is a look at how Windows engineers improve the baseline performance and consistency for scenarios like Instant On.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Measurement</strong>: All performance analysis starts with adding code to emit diagnostic data events that can be used for measurement or identifying system resource usage. We rely heavily on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows">ETW</a> to measure daily results to ensure we prevent regressions prior to selfhost.</li>
 	<li><strong>Optimize the baseline</strong>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">We analyze ETW traces through automated trace analysis techniques using </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/trace-processing/overview">DataLayer</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in some cases, manually using </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer">Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In WPA, engineers deploy a range of analysis techniques from resource usage (like </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/cpu-analysis">CPU Analysis</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to </span><a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/optimizing-performance-and-responsiveness-exercise-3">critical path analysis</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to identify issues in software and hardware that can be optimized.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Optimize the distribution at scale</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Using the optics that engineering teams add to their features, we observe light weight performance data (e.g. overall time for Windows Hello face authentication) across a diversity of Windows hardware. From this data, we can see the gap between the 90th/95th/99th percentiles and more common cases at the 10th and 50th percentiles.</li>
 	<li>We then collect verbose performance diagnostics at scale from a smaller sample of Windows users across a diversity of hardware and Windows OS configurations.</li>
 	<li>We then leverage our automatic trace analysis techniques using resource usage and critical path analysis, to build a stack chart of performance issues across the distribution and their relative impact. This scale analysis helps us deeply understand the performance bottlenecks across a broad range of devices and helps us prioritize the most impactful opportunities.  This chart shows an example of this analysis for Windows Hello face authentication.</li>
 	<li>Finally, we double-check a set of the top performance traces in these buckets from the scale approach to confirm the insights from scale analysis and build a solution with engineering teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-56780 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-3-Windows-Hello-example.png" alt="" width="624" height="314" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Listen to customer feedback</strong>: Feedback from customers through channels like Feedback Hub help us identify areas where we need new optics or investigation outside of our current flow. For Instant On, our team monitors a few Feedback Hub categories and contexts like "Power and Battery >> Sleep" and "Security and Privacy >> Windows Hello Face." When customers "Add more details" in Feedback Hub by reproducing and hitting "Record my issue," we have the rich data necessary to diagnose problems effectively.</li>
</ul>
Across recent Windows 11 updates, we have optimized:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>More security with better performance for Enhanced Secure Sign-On (ESS)</strong>. ESS provides increased security by building memory enclaves that can be hidden from the rest of the system.  We improved performance by up to 10% in cases where the system is under memory pressure by more efficiently handling the secure enclaves’ large slabs of memory.  This also enables us to ship on a larger range of RAM sizes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consistent Windows Hello performance with app orchestration</strong>. When you resume your machine and kick off Windows Hello, apps also start resuming in the background and can consume system resources, slowing down your Hello performance.  We delay the resume of these apps until after Windows Hello camera startup and face authentication is complete.</li>
</ul>
These features are now available to customers and will enable faster Instant On experience with fewer Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) on the lock screen that can save up to 8% in cases where many apps are resuming.
<h3>What Is New?</h3>
We continue to invest in ensuring core Windows scenarios have great fundamentals.  Over the course of the last year, we also asked each feature team-building experiences in Windows to take a close look at their features to find additional opportunities to optimize the OS experiences.  We were surprised and energized by the breadth of optimizations made across the entire product, and we are excited to bring these improvements to all our customers.

We started this effort by conducting trainings across the entire organization on best practices, techniques, and educating the organization on the latest tools and techniques for performance analysis.  The energy and momentum that this created was invigorating as every team was empowered to improve any part of the operating system they chose.  This effort resulted in over 300 different performance improvements across Windows!  Here is a subset of some of the improvements available for you on all your Windows 11 devices.

<strong>Faster, more responsive post-boot experience</strong>

Today, when you boot a PC, there are a number of things that happen behind the scenes.  If you have a lot of apps registered to start at boot, it can be a stampede of apps all clamoring for resources to launch.  While investigating a boot perf issue, we experimented with moderating app startups.

What we found was we can both ensure the apps the user is trying to interact with are responsive and prioritized, and also that in many cases the background apps finish launching faster due to reduced contention.  Rather than unleash all the start up apps at once, we moderate their launches.  This helps avoid significant contention at launch and ensures the foreground app the user is interacting with stays performant and responsive.

These improvements most benefit devices with fewer resources, and we measured a 25-50% improvement in application launch times in the time period after logon in our experiment with multiple startup apps.  The image below helps visualize this, where we moderate startup apps to ensure that user-initiated operations can run with less contention.  In this example, you can see the user’s app completes its launch faster, and the background startup apps also complete in a similar timeframe due to less contention for resources.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56781 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-4-Moderated-app-start-up.png" alt="" width="874" height="318" />

<strong>File Explorer improvements</strong>

We made several improvements in File Explorer, including improving launch time of File explorer for users who have files stored in the cloud by avoiding I/O to enumerate cloud files.  We also looked at deleting files and made improvements to bulk file delete operations by over 40% as shown in our results below!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56777 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-5-File-Explorer-delete.png" alt="" width="414" height="366" />

While it may be rare for users to delete large numbers of files on their device all at once, the example shows the breadth of the improvements we set out to bring to Windows 11 users.

<strong>Reduced game stutter with high report rate mice</strong>

We know gamers hate stutter, and we’re fixing issues throughout Windows so that an untimely frame-freeze won’t take gamers out of their immersive experiences.  Gamers love to push their systems to the limit in search of the best experiences in-game.  Many also use sensitive, high DPI, high report rate mice to shave milliseconds off their response times and increase precision.  At the same time, the world of gaming is more connected than ever with gamers relying on an increasing number of background apps while playing, like voice chat, streaming, apps for configuring your keyboard, mouse, or graphics card, and more.  The Windows input stack was being pushed to its limits with high report rate mice and their input being delivered to not just the game, but also multiple background processes.  In turn, that caused a significant amount of time processing input rather than providing as many cycles as possible for rendering the game experience.

We set out to reduce the amount of processing time it took to handle input requests by throttling and coalescing background raw mouse listeners and capping their message rate.  Prior to these changes, we observed on a Surface Laptop Studio with a 1000 Hz mouse, a test bed of background listeners, and popular games that there was significant stutter.  After the improvements, on the same setup, we now deliver a smooth, uninterrupted gaming experience and preserve the low latency, high precision input experience in games while being efficient with input for background listeners!

<strong>Something for everyone</strong>

While the examples above highlight some of the improvements in the February and May updates, there are many other improvements available today, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Taskbar improvements to ensure Taskbar is readily available after logging in</li>
 	<li>Task View performance improvements when devices are under heavy load</li>
 	<li>Improved performance of Windows Notification Service</li>
 	<li>Improved launch time of Quick Settings and Notification Center</li>
 	<li>Reduced threads, dlls, and graphics device count in Explorer</li>
 	<li>Reduced CPU usage of explorer</li>
 	<li>Reduced memory usage of Notification Center</li>
 	<li>Touch keyboard performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Resource usage reductions in multi-user scenarios</li>
 	<li>Reduced voice access and Narrator latency in larger documents</li>
 	<li>Improved voice typing activation time</li>
 	<li>Improved speed of theme changes</li>
 	<li>Reduced size on disk by leveraging features-on-demand via the Store</li>
</ul>
For developers, there is a lot coming in the May release too.  Some highlights that intersect fundamentals:
<ul>
 	<li>New enhanced kernel minidump format for better debugging</li>
 	<li>Live kernel dumps can now be collected directly via Task Manager</li>
 	<li>New richer, more actionable third-party reliability data views in Partner Center</li>
 	<li>Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) is now supported and available on Arm devices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applications That Run on Windows Have Improved</h3>
There are great recent wins across key apps on Windows as well that we should celebrate.  We partner closely with these teams, share approaches to performance and fundamentals, and collaborate on improvements.

<strong>Microsoft Edge performance improvements</strong>

Browsing the web is one of the most common activities users perform.  Edge continually invests in not just improving the browsing experience for users, but in improving performance and minimizing resource usage.  Sleeping Tabs was introduced in Edge over a year ago, and the team has continued to improve the effectiveness of it to reduce memory and power usage of tabs.  Most users have up to 7 tabs open at any point in time, and while only 1 tab is often visible, those other tabs can have significant impacts on both memory and power.

With Sleeping Tabs, when you switch away from a tab we can reduce the memory and CPU usage of the background tabs, and just as importantly, we are able to resume faster than if we fully discarded the background tab.  Our diagnostic data shows that at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, a tab can consume as much as 400MB of private working set.  With up to 6 tabs in the background, this adds up to nearly 2.4GB of memory being consumed.  With Sleeping Tabs, we can reduce the private working set of a tab down to 75MB!  A savings of nearly 2GB of memory (83% reduction), providing memory to other applications and services.  In addition, we have seen an over 15% improvement in the startup time of the Edge browser!

When you are mobile, getting the most out of your battery is important so you can keep working until you can plug in again.  Efficiency mode in Microsoft Edge helps you get the most out of every charge.  Through efficient reduction of CPU usage, Microsoft Edge can extend battery life on average of 25 minutes when efficiency mode is active.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-56782 size-large" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Figure-8-Edge-Sleeping-Tabs-1024x513.png" alt="" width="1024" height="513" />

<strong>The New Microsoft Teams App for Windows</strong>

Microsoft Teams has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and the team intently focused on scale and rapid growth.  Together, we spent quite a bit of time understanding the common use cases and scenarios.  A big focus for the team was moving to a new architecture and backend services that drove a 2x performance improvement, while consuming half the resources.  Bold fundamentals goals were set that required the team to step back and rearchitect significant parts of the software that enables all of us to connect and collaborate across the globe!  For more details on the improvements made with the new Teams client refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/27/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-microsoft-teams/">Teams blog</a>.
