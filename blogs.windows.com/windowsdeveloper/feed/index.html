										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the latest release of Dev Home, where we’ve been working to deliver your top asks. Dev Home is available by default and is open source on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>. Let’s dive into what‘s new!
<h2>Machine configuration improvements</h2>
The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/setup">machine configuration</a> tool is intended to help you get your developer machine set up in a snap. We’ve made some improvements to it with additional <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/">WinGet DSC</a> integration. You can now generate a configuration file after going through the setup flow and Dev Home will also detect a configuration file in a repo after cloning. We’ve also added a new summary and details view when running configuration files.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57056 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/machine-config.png" alt="Machine configuration screen" width="624" height="455" data-wp-editing="1" />
<h3>Quickstart Playground</h3>
Quickstart Playground is a new experimental feature within machine configuration that allows you to quickly spin up a development project with the power of AI. To learn more about Quickstart Playground, check out our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/quickstart-playground">docs</a>.
<h2>Environments</h2>
We’re making it even easier to get into your development flows by providing access to different environment types all in one place. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/environments">environments in Dev Home</a>, you can create, connect, and configure environments such as Hyper-V virtual machines and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/">Microsoft Dev Boxes</a> all in one centralized view. Microsoft Dev Box support comes with the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mv8f79fgxtr">Dev Home Azure extension</a>.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57057 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/environments.png" alt="Environment screen" width="468" height="253" />
<h2>Windows customization</h2>
Windows customization in Dev Home grants you the ability to tweak additional settings within Windows to get a fully tailored experience. We’ve provided additional toggles for tweaking File Explorer along with Dev Drive insights. Dev Drive insights provides information on your Dev Drive volumes as well as suggestions for how to increase performance within them. The Windows customization feature is in active development and will get even more settings soon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-57058 size-full" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2024/06/win-cust.png" alt="Windows customization screen" width="624" height="381" />
<h3>Quiet background processes</h3>
Within Windows customization lives an experimental feature called Quiet background processes. Running this feature will enable a session to defer some background processes, thus freeing up resources for development tools. Each session can run for up to two hours and you can see an analytic summary of CPU usage after it ends.
<h2>Utilities</h2>
Utilities in Dev Home brings additional developer tooling to Windows. With its initial release, we’ve added the top requested <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys#installing-and-running-microsoft-powertoys">PowerToys</a> tools to Windows. These are Registry Editor, Hosts File Editor, and Environment Variables editor. We’re looking to add more utilities here in the future, and if you have any you’d like to see, please file a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/devhome">GitHub</a>.

<p>The post <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/06/03/microsoft-photos-migrating-from-uwp-to-windows-app-sdk/">Microsoft Photos: Migrating from UWP to Windows App SDK</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper">Windows Developer Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfjbh4?hl=en-US&gl=US">Microsoft Photos App</a> team recently released a major update, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/02/windows-photos-begins-previewing-a-windows-app-sdk-version-to-windows-insiders/">switching platforms from UWP to Windows App SDK</a>. This blog post documents our experience switching platforms, including some impactful benefits and some interesting technical challenges.

The new Photos application is already fully rolled out to Windows Insiders and is now rolling out to Retail customers starting with version 2024.11050.3002.0 and above.
<h2>Concurrent Development & Replatforming</h2>
As one of the most frequently used apps, we're continually releasing new features such as <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/03/photos-app-for-windows-11-update-brings-improvements-for-windows-insiders/">Slideshow</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/17/windows-photos-gets-background-remove-and-replace-along-with-other-improvements/">Background Removal</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/22/windows-photos-gets-generative-erase-and-recent-ai-editing-features-now-available-on-arm64-devices-and-windows-10/">Generative Erase</a>. Maintaining the ability to ship new features like these on UWP, whilst also progressing the platform switch to Windows App SDK was paramount. In simple terms, this meant all changes – both new features and Windows App SDK changes – had to go into our primary development branch. To do this with the least amount of disruption, we adopted some strategies to ensure code changes were compatible with both platforms concurrently:
<ol>
 	<li>Parallel Pull Request build validation for both UWP & Windows App SDK app variants</li>
 	<li>Conditional compilation (ifdefs) for similar but incompatible APIs</li>
 	<li>Namespace aliases for equivalent Windows:: and Microsoft:: APIs
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">#ifdef WIN_APP_SDK
namespace WUXM = winrt::Microsoft::UI::Xaml::Media;
#else
namespace WUXM = winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Media;
#endif</pre>
</li>
 	<li>Conditional inclusion of XAML source files since conditional compilation is unsupported</li>
</ol>
<h2>Processes & Integrity Level</h2>
In UWP applications, processes run at lowIL (low integrity level), also known as ‘AppContainer’, meaning <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/win32-and-com/win32-and-com-for-uwp-apps">certain APIs are restricted</a> or could require additional user confirmation prompts. In Win32 applications, including Windows App SDK, processes generally run at mediumIL (medium integrity level), meaning the app has a higher privilege level.

Using Windows App SDK, we can now save an edited file in the same folder as the original file (e.g. “foo_edited.jpg”) without requesting the user to choose the destination folder.

Due to reasons including cross-platform compatibility and privilege checking, equivalent UWP APIs such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.storagefolder.getfilesasync?view=winrt-22621">StorageFolder.GetFilesAsync</a> can be orders of magnitude slower than their corresponding Win32 APIs such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findnextfilea">FindNextFile</a>. This is especially true for file system APIs, and when dealing with large photo collections spanning 100,000+ files, the performance difference could be significant – seconds vs minutes.
<h2>PhotosService.exe</h2>
Requiring users to wait several minutes to see all their media wouldn’t be a great user experience. To achieve acceptable performance with the UWP version of the Photos App, we used a multi-process architecture including both a lowIL primary process, and a mediumIL background process “PhotosService.exe” – a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities">restricted capability</a> only available to verified publishers.

Implementing this required significant complexity:
<ol>
 	<li>Using WAP (Windows Application Packaging) to package both UWP and Win32 Applications for deployment</li>
 	<li>Adding the restricted <em>“runFullTrust”</em> capability in the AppxManifest to allow the inclusion of a mediumIL executable in the package</li>
 	<li>Building an IPC (interprocess communication) system using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes">Named Pipes</a> to allow RPC calls between two processes:</li>
</ol>

With the migration to Windows App SDK, this complex logic has been removed and integrated into a single process, dramatically simplifying our app architecture, and bringing improved performance due to the removal of interprocess communication.

One important point on the new approach is that Photos is still a multi-threaded application, and to receive File System notification events it was necessary to implement a headless window on a separate thread to isolate it from the XAML UI thread.

<h2>WebView2</h2>
Another huge benefit of Windows App SDK is the addition of WebView2, built upon the new Chromium-based Edge browser. The Photos App uses web tech in a few places, including with our cross-platform image editor used in both OneDrive and the Photos App. Some key benefits of WebView2 include:
<ol>
 	<li>WebGL support enabling improved image rendering quality.</li>
 	<li>Superior performance when sharing high quality images between the native and web layers using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/winrt/microsoft_web_webview2_core/corewebview2sharedbuffer?view=webview2-winrt-1.0.2535.41">SharedBuffer</a>.</li>
 	<li>Supporting a more up to date version of Chromium, which carries the latest improvements and security updates.</li>
 	<li>Allowing us to optimize the performance of our AI Service which requires sending pixel buffers back and forth from our Web Editor to our Native App for AI inference.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Maintenance and Support</h2>
As an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/05/10/reimagining-the-apps-included-with-windows-11/">Inbox</a> app (included in Windows), we need to ensure Photos is running reliably for users across all supported versions of Windows. In Windows App SDK, most of the platform code is shipped as part of the WindowsAppRuntime package, in stark contrast to UWP where it’s all shipped as part of the Windows operating system.

The key difference between these two models is that users automatically get the latest platform updates to the Photos App on Windows App SDK, whereas in UWP they would have to wait for those changes to be included in Windows Update servicing patches.

In practical terms, this means we’ve often needed to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)">polyfills</a> to patch bugs, re-implement missing APIs, or even disable features entirely on older OS versions. With Windows App SDK this is no longer needed, saving precious development time and reducing the testing overhead required for different OS versions.
<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
<h3>ASTA vs STA</h3>
In UWP, the threading model was based on ASTA (Application Single-Threaded Apartment) which has a mechanism to protect the XAML UI thread against reentrancy. In contrast, Windows App SDK uses a regular STA model which requires some extra care when executing certain calls from the XAML UI thread, which could otherwise cause reentrancy and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/guides/threading#stowed-exceptions">Stowed Exceptions</a>.

For most of the cases the fix would be to re-enqueue the problematic call with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.dispatching.dispatcherqueue">DispatcherQueue</a> if it has to run in the UI thread. Another approach is to offload certain tasks to a background thread to decouple the re-entrant logic from the UI thread.
<h3>AutoPlay Support</h3>
One major feature of Photos is the ability for users to connect flash drives and mobile phone devices to import their media files. In Windows App SDK this feature has not yet been implemented, but there is a good alternative using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/autoplay2k-using">Win32 shell APIs</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop3-autoplayhandler">desktop3:AutoPlayHandler</a>.

This feature works by deploying and running a separated COM server process that handles autoplay activation and launches the Photos App’s import workflow.

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
Switching to Windows App SDK has allowed the Photos App to continue using the beautiful, cohesive, native user interface components included in WinUI, whilst adding the ability to directly call Win32 APIs and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api">maintaining compatibility</a> with the majority of UWP APIs. On the platform side, switching to Windows App SDK enables all Photos App users to receive the latest stability & performance improvements immediately, since the Windows App Runtime updates as a dependency of the Photos App package install.

Upgrading from UWP to Windows App SDK represents a larger change than previous Windows app platform updates, however the corresponding benefits significantly outweigh the development cost.

In the future we’ll be taking further advantage of Windows App SDK by having each Photos App window run in its own process – an architecture already used with overwhelming success in Chromium-based web browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Enjoy this sneak-peek of the upcoming performance improvements!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[DirectML support for Phi 3 mini launched last month and we’ve since made several improvements, unlocking more models and even better performance!

Developers can grab already quantized versions of Phi-3 mini (with variants for the <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx">4k</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx">128k</a> versions). They can now also get Phi 3 medium (<a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-4k-instruct-onnx-directml">4k</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-onnx-directml">128k</a>)  and <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-ONNX">Mistral v0.2</a>. Stay tuned for additional pre-quantized models! We’ve also shipped a gradio interface to make easier to test these models with the new ONNX Runtime Generate() API. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/tree/main/examples/chat_app">Learn more</a>.

</ul>
<h2>What is quantization?</h2>
Memory bandwidth is often a bottleneck for getting models to run on entry-level and older hardware, especially when it comes to language models. This means that making language models smaller directly translates to increasing the breadth of devices developers can target.

There’s been a lot of research into reducing model size through quantization, a process that reduces the precision and therefore size of model weights.

Our goal is to ensure scalability, while also maintaining model accuracy, so we integrated support for models that have had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978">Activation-Aware Quantization</a> (AWQ) applied to them. AWQ is a technique that lets us reap the memory savings from quantization with only a minimal impact on accuracy. AWQ achieves this by identifying the top 1% of salient weights that are needed for maintaining model accuracy and then quantizes the remaining 99% of weights. This leads to much less accuracy loss with AWQ compared to other techniques.

The average person reads up to <a href="https://wordsrated.com/reading-speed-statistics/">5 words/second</a>. Thanks to the significant memory wins from AWQ, Phi-3-mini runs at this speed or faster on older discrete GPUs and even laptop integrated GPUs. This translates into being able to run Phi-3-mini on hundreds of millions of devices!

Check out our Build talk below to see this in action!
<h2>Perplexity measurements</h2>
Perplexity is a measure used to quantify how well a model predicts a sample. Without getting into the math of it all, a lower perplexity score means the model is more certain about its predictions and suggests that the model's probability distribution is closer to the true distribution of the data.

Perplexity can be thought of as a way to quantify the average number of branches in front of a model at each decision point. At each step, a lower perplexity would mean that the model has fewer, more confident choices to make, which reflects a more refined understanding of the topic. A higher perplexity would mean more, less confident choices and therefore choices that are less predictable, relevant, and/or varied in quality.

As you can see below our data shows that AWQ leads to a small loss in model accuracy with only a small increase in perplexity. In return, using AWQ means 4x smaller model weights, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of devices that can run Phi-3-mini!

WebNN is a game-changer for web development. It’s an emerging web standard that defines how to run machine learning models in the browser, using the hardware acceleration of your local device’s GPU or NPU. This way, you can enjoy web applications that use machine learning without any extra software or plugins, and without compromising your privacy or security. WebNN opens up new possibilities for web applications, such as generative AI, object recognition, natural language processing, and more.

WebNN is a web standard that defines how to interface with different backends for hardware accelerated ML inference. One of the backends that WebNN can use is DirectML, which provides performant, cross-hardware ML acceleration across Windows devices. By leveraging DirectML, WebNN can benefit from the hardware scale, performance, and reliability of DirectML.

With WebNN, you can unleash the power of ML models in your web app. It offers you the core elements of ML, such as tensors, operators, and graphs. You can also combine it with ONNX Runtime Web, a JavaScript library that enables you to run ONNX models in the browser.

<span data-contrast="none">Over the last year, we have worked on reimagining </span> <span data-contrast="none">Windows PCs and yesterday, we introduced the world to a new category of Windows PCs called </span><b><span data-contrast="none">Copilot+ PCs.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="none">Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever with AI infused at every layer, starting with the world’s most powerful PC Neural Processing Units (NPUs) capable of delivering 40+ TOPS of compute. The new class of PCs is up to 20 times more </span><span data-contrast="none">powerful</span><span data-contrast="none"><sup>1</sup></span><span data-contrast="none"> and up to 100 times as efficient</span><span data-contrast="none"><sup>2</sup></span><span data-contrast="none"> for running AI workloads compared to traditional PCs. This is a quantum leap in performance, made possible by a quantum leap in efficiency. The NPU is part of a new System on Chip (SoC) that enables the most powerful and efficient Windows PCs ever built, with outstanding performance, incredible all day battery life, and great app experiences. Copilot+ PCs will be available in June, starting with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Series processors. Later this year we will have more devices in this category from Intel and AMD. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:262}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="none">I am also excited that Qualcomm announced this morning its </span><b><span data-contrast="none">Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows </span></b><span data-contrast="none">which has a special developer edition Snapdragon X Elite SoC. Featuring the NPU that powers the Copilot+ PCs, the Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows has a form factor that is easily stackable and is designed specifically to be a developer’s everyday dev box, providing the maximum power and flexibility developers need. It is powered by a 3.8 GHz 12 Core Oryon CPU with dual core boost up to 4.3GHz, comes with 32 GB LPDDR5x memory, 512GB M2 storage, 80 Watt system architecture, support for up to 3 concurrent external displays and uses 20% ocean-bound-plastic. </span><a href="https://aka.ms/SDDevKitBlog"><span data-contrast="none">Learn more</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Recall database is powered by Windows Semantic Index, a new OS capability that redefines search on Windows. Recall is grounded in several state-of-the-art AI models, including multi-modal SLMs, running concurrently and integrated into the OS itself. These models understand different kinds of content and work across several languages, to organize a vast sea of information from text to image to videos, in Windows. This data is transformed and stored in a vector store called Windows Semantic Index. The semantic index is stored entirely on the user’s local device and accessible through natural language search. This deep integration allows a uniquely robust approach to privacy as the data does not leave the local device.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:262}"> </span>

With full NPU offload of prompt processing, the first token latency is at 650 tokens/second - and only costs about 1.5 Watts of power while leaving your CPU and GPU free for other computations. Token generation reuses the KV cache from the NPU and runs on the CPU producing about 27 tokens/second.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:20,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Continuing investments in WinUI3 and WPF to help developers build rich, modern Windows applications </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Windows is an open and versatile platform that supports a wide range of UI technologies. If you are looking to develop native Windows applications using our preferred UI development language, XAML, we recommend using either WinUI 3 or WPF.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">WinUI 3 includes a modern native compositor and excels at media and graphics-focused consumer and commercial applications. WPF has a longer history and can take advantage of a deep ecosystem of commercial products as well as free and open source projects, many of which are focused on enterprise and data-intensive scenarios. We recommend you first consider WinUI 3, and if that meets your app’s  needs, proceed with it for the most modern experience. Otherwise, WPF is an excellent choice. Both WinUI 3 and WPF can take advantage of all Windows has to offer, including the new features and APIs in the Windows App SDK, so you can feel confident in creating a modern application in either technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">With the latest updates to Windows App SDK 1.5+ we shipped several developer-requested features including support for .NET 8, with its faster startup, smaller footprint, and new runtime features. We’ve also brought to WinUI 3 one of the most requested features, the Maps control, powered by WebView 2 and Azure Maps. You can learn more about the controls and features in WinUI 3 in the interactive </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC?ocid=pdpshare"><span data-contrast="none">WinUI 3 Gallery App</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Microsoft App Assure team helps app developers around the world to ensure their users have top-notch experience on all Microsoft platforms. Today, I want to highlight one of our many successful engagements: the new Opera Browser for Arm-based Windows devices. In May, an Arm-optimized version of Opera for Windows was made available on the <a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/developer">developer stream</a> of the browser. Engineering assistance from the Microsoft App Assure team played a key role in this effort.

The App Assure program delivers on Microsoft’s application compatibility promise: your apps will run on Windows on Arm, and if you encounter any issues, Microsoft will help you remediate them. This no-cost program has a proven track record helping over 300 market-leading developers build Arm-optimized apps for Windows. With the recent worldwide release of our <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/03/13/announcing-worldwide-availability-of-arm-advisory-service-for-developers/">Arm Advisory Service</a>, more developers than ever before have been turning to App Assure for guidance.

We continue to see excitement in the market for the coming wave of Windows PCs based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform. These new devices feature powerful on-device AI capability, which will herald a new age of groundbreaking AI features. As with all Arm-based Windows devices, they offer fast connectivity, extended battery life, best-in-class performance, advanced camera capabilities, along with many other benefits.
<h4>Porting to Windows Arm is easy</h4>
Windows users expect their favorite apps to work great on Arm-based PCs. To meet this expectation, App Assure engages with the most popular apps, such as the Opera Browser, helping them optimize for the platform. App Assure engineers worked directly with Opera’s engineering team, offering technical assistance and guidance. It quickly became apparent that both teams had a similar take on strong signals reflecting growing industry awareness of the performance and efficiency benefits offered by Arm devices.

“Windows is our biggest audience, so it is very important for us to deliver a seamless experience on all Windows devices,” said Bartosz Wiklak, head of QA and Automation at Opera. “We had been seeing increased market excitement about the future of Arm-based PCs for some time. When the App Assure team got in touch with us, we decided it was a great time to start focusing on it. We always aim to be at the forefront of the adoption curve and offer more options for our customers.”

Through a series of technical workshops, App Assure engineers met with Opera engineers to discuss the nuts and bolts of optimizing for Arm. These in-depth sessions provided a deep dive into the intricacies of Arm's architecture, covering details that go beyond simple cross-platform build configuration or signing multi-architecture app bundles. App Assure engineers also provided technical documentation to further Opera’s understanding of Windows on Arm. This work helped lay the foundation for a version of Opera that is not only compatible with Arm devices, but also takes advantage of the best-in-class performance offered by these devices.

“Our experience developing for other Arm platforms was that it took quite a bit of work, so we were initially concerned about the time commitment. But when we looked deeper into it, we found out that a lot of the porting work had already been done in the Chromium project for the Arm-native release of Microsoft Edge. So, it was a very smooth process. We produced a first build in just a few days.” said Wiklak. “Once the builds passed quality bar, we benchmarked optimized browser using Speedometer, a widely popular benchmark for web browsers. We were really pleased that the score was more than double when compared to emulated version.” The Arm-optimized version of Opera will be first available on the <a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/developer">developer stream</a> of the browser, allowing early adopters to try it out on Arm-based Windows devices.
